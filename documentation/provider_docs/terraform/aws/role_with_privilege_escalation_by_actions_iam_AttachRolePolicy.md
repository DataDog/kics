## Metadata
**Name:** `aws/role_with_privilege_escalation_by_actions_iam_AttachRolePolicy`
**Id:** `f465fff1-0a0f-457d-aa4d-1bddb6f204ff`
**Cloud Provider:** aws
**Severity:** Medium
**Category:** Access Control
## Description
Granting an IAM role permission to perform `iam:AttachRolePolicy` with `Resource = "*"` allows the role to attach any policy to any role in the AWS environment, including itself. This enables privilege escalation, as a user or process with this permission can grant themselves full administrative privileges or access beyond what was originally intended. If left unaddressed, such a configuration could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or full compromise of the AWS account.
