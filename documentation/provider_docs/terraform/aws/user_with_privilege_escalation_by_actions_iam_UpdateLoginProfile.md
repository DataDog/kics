## Metadata
**Name:** `aws/user_with_privilege_escalation_by_actions_iam_UpdateLoginProfile`
**Id:** `6deb34e2-5d9c-499a-801b-ea6d9eda894f`
**Cloud Provider:** aws
**Severity:** Medium
**Category:** Access Control
## Description
Allowing a user the `iam:UpdateLoginProfile` permission with the `Resource` set to `"*"` in Terraform, as in:

```
Action = [
  "iam:UpdateLoginProfile",
]
Resource = "*"
```

enables that user to change the passwords of any IAM user in the AWS account. This creates a privilege escalation risk, as the user could assign themselves or others passwords to high-privilege accounts, resulting in unauthorized access or control over critical resources. If left unaddressed, this misconfiguration can lead to account compromise and the potential for significant security incidents.
