### Description

 Roles or ClusterRoles that permit attaching to containers via `kubectl attach` can be abused by attackers to read process output (stdout, stderr) and send input (stdin) to running processes.
They can also allow a malicious user to attach to a privileged container, resulting in privilege escalation.
For this reason, the `pods/attach` resource should not be included in production Role or ClusterRole rules. This rule flags Role or ClusterRole documents whose rules include the `pods/attach` resource (and related verb entries such as `create` or `*`). Findings support least-privilege enforcement by identifying and removing attach permissions from cluster roles.


## Compliant Code Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: allow-attach-neg
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: allow-attach-neg
  namespace: my-namespace
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: bob
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: allow-attach-neg
  apiGroup: ""

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```yaml
