### Description

 The container `imagePullPolicy` must be set to `Always`. This requirement applies when the image is referenced with an explicit tag (contains ':') and is not referenced by digest (`@...`) or by the `:latest` tag. Setting `imagePullPolicy` to `Always` ensures the image is pulled on every start and prevents relying on mutable images cached locally.


## Compliant Code Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: private-image-test-1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: uses-private-image
      image: $PRIVATE_IMAGE_NAME
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      command: [ "echo", "SUCCESS" ]
```

        - name: nginx
          image: library/nginx:1.20.0
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
