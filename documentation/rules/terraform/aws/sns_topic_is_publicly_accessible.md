### Description

 This check verifies that Amazon SNS topic policies do not allow public access by having wildcard principals in their IAM policies. When an SNS topic policy includes a principal with wildcard (`*`) or allows anonymous access, it makes the topic publicly accessible to any AWS account, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized message publishing/consumption.

Secure configuration requires specifying explicit IAM principals rather than using wildcards. For example, instead of using `"AWS": "*"` which grants access to anyone, use a specific account ARN like `"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::account_number:root"` to limit access to authorized entities only. This prevents unauthorized access to your SNS topics and their messages.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_sns_topic" "negative1" {
policy = <<EOF
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Action": "*",
"Principal": {
  "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::##account_number##:root"
},
"Effect": "Allow",
"Sid": ""
}
]
}
EOF
}


```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_sns_topic" "positive1" {
policy = <<EOF
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Action": "*",
"Principal": {
  "AWS": "*"
},
"Effect": "Allow",
"Sid": ""
}
]
}
EOF
