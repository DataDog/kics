### Description

 AWS CloudWatch log groups should use KMS encryption to protect sensitive log data at rest. When the `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` resource is defined without the `kms_key_id` attribute, as in the following example, logs are stored unencrypted or with default encryption, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access if AWS accounts or storage is compromised:

```
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "negative1" {
  name = "Yada"
  retention_in_days = 1
}
```

By specifying the `kms_key_id` attribute, you ensure that log data is encrypted with a customer-managed AWS KMS key, reducing the risk of data exposure.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "negative1" {
  name = "Yada"

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Application = "serviceA"
  }

  retention_in_days = 1
  kms_key_id = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "negative1" {
  name = "Yada"

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Application = "serviceA"
  }

  retention_in_days = 1
}

```
