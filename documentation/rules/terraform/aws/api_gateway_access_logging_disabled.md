### Description

 When configuring an AWS API Gateway stage in Terraform, it is important to define the `access_log_settings` block to ensure that access logs are collected and sent to a centralized logging destination, such as an Amazon CloudWatch Logs group. Without specifying the `access_log_settings`, as shown in the configuration below, API requests and responses will not be logged, making it difficult to detect anomalous activity, debug issues, or perform security investigations:

```
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "example" {
  stage_name  = "dev"
  rest_api_id = "id"
  // Missing access_log_settings
}
```

The absence of access logging creates a blind spot in monitoring and incident response, potentially allowing malicious activities and API misuse to go unnoticed. To address this, always include the `access_log_settings` block in your API Gateway stage resource, specifying a valid `destination_arn`:

```
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "example" {
  stage_name  = "dev"
  rest_api_id = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:your-log-group"
  }
}
```

Enabling access logging helps meet compliance requirements and establishes a robust audit trail for all API interactions.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "negative1" {
  stage_name    = "dev"
  rest_api_id   = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "dest"
  }
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_method_settings" "all" {
  stage_name  = aws_api_gateway_stage.negative1.stage_name
  method_path = "*/*"

  settings {
    metrics_enabled = true
    logging_level   = "ERROR"
  }
}

resource "aws_apigatewayv2_stage" "negative2" {
  stage_name    = "dev"
  rest_api_id   = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "dest"
  }

  default_route_settings {
    logging_level   = "ERROR"
  }
}


```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "postive1" {
  stage_name    = "dev"
  rest_api_id   = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "dest"
  }
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_method_settings" "all" {
  stage_name  = aws_api_gateway_stage.postive1.stage_name
  method_path = "*/*"

  settings {
  }
}


resource "aws_apigatewayv2_stage" "postive2" {
  stage_name    = "dev"
  rest_api_id   = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "dest"
  }

  default_route_settings {
  }
}

```

```terraform
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "postive1" {
  stage_name    = "dev"
  rest_api_id   = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "dest"
  }
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_method_settings" "all" {
  stage_name  = aws_api_gateway_stage.postive1.stage_name
  method_path = "*/*"

  settings {
    logging_level   = ""
  }
}

resource "aws_apigatewayv2_stage" "postive2" {
  stage_name    = "dev"
  rest_api_id   = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "dest"
  }

  default_route_settings {
    logging_level   = ""
  }
}

```

```terraform
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "postive1" {
  stage_name    = "dev"
  rest_api_id   = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "dest"
  }
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_method_settings" "all" {
  stage_name  = aws_api_gateway_stage.postive1.stage_name
  method_path = "*/*"

  settings {
    metrics_enabled = true
  }
}

resource "aws_apigatewayv2_stage" "postive2" {
  stage_name    = "dev"
  rest_api_id   = "id"

  access_log_settings {
    destination_arn = "dest"
  }

  default_route_settings {
    data_trace_enabled = "true"
  }
}
