### Description

 Allowing the `iam:PutUserPolicy` action with a `Resource` value of `"*"` in a Terraform AWS IAM role or policy configuration allows any user assigned the role to attach arbitrary policies to any users in the AWS account. This creates a significant privilege escalation vulnerability, as an attacker could grant themselves or others increased permissions, potentially leading to full administrative access. To mitigate this risk, the scope of the `PutUserPolicy` action should be strictly restricted to only the necessary resources and users.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "cosmic2" {
  name = "cosmic2"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "inline_policy_run_instances2" {
  name = "inline_policy_run_instances"
  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_iam_role" "cosmic" {
  name = "cosmic"
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "test_inline_policy" {
  name = "test_inline_policy"
  role = aws_iam_role.cosmic.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "iam:PutUserPolicy",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
