## Metadata

**Name:** `aws/elasticsearch_with_https_disabled`

**Query Name** `Elasticsearch with HTTPS disabled`

**Id:** `2e9e0729-66d5-4148-9d39-5e6fb4bf2a4e`

**Cloud Provider:** aws

**Platform** Terraform

**Severity:** Medium

**Category:** Networking and Firewall

## Description
Amazon Elasticsearch domains should enforce HTTPS by setting the `enforce_https` attribute to `true` in the `domain_endpoint_options` block. If `enforce_https` is left set to `false`, as shown below, communication with the Elasticsearch domain can occur over unencrypted HTTP, exposing data to interception and increasing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

```
domain_endpoint_options {
  enforce_https = false
}
```

To mitigate this, always configure:

```
domain_endpoint_options {
  enforce_https = true
}
```

Enforcing HTTPS ensures that all data transmitted between clients and the Elasticsearch service is encrypted, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
