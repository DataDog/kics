### Description

 Application Load Balancers (ALBs) should always be protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to defend against common web exploits and vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Without an associated WAF, ALBs are left exposed to the internet with no filter or mitigation in place for potentially malicious traffic targeting applications. This misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and disruptions to application availability, compromising the security and integrity of hosted applications. Ensuring that ALBs have an active WAF association is a critical best practice for reducing the risk of successful web-based attacks.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_lb" "alb" {
  name               = "test-lb-tf"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.lb_sg.id]
  subnets            = [for subnet in aws_subnet.public : subnet.id]
}

resource "aws_wafv2_web_acl_association" "alb_waf_association" {
  resource_arn = aws_lb.alb.arn
  web_acl_arn  = aws_wafv2_web_acl.example.arn
}
```

```terraform
resource "aws_alb" "foo33" {
  internal = false
  subnets  = [aws_subnet.foo.id, aws_subnet.bar.id]
}

resource "aws_wafregional_web_acl_association" "foo_waf33" {
  resource_arn = aws_alb.foo33.arn
  web_acl_id   = aws_wafregional_web_acl.foo.id
}
# trigger validation

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_lb" "alb" {
  name               = "test-lb-tf"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.lb_sg.id]
  subnets            = [for subnet in aws_subnet.public : subnet.id]
}

resource "aws_wafv2_web_acl_association" "alb_waf_association" {
  resource_arn = aws_lb.alba.arn
  web_acl_arn  = aws_wafv2_web_acl.example.arn
}
```

```terraform
resource "aws_alb" "foo" {
  internal = false
  subnets  = [aws_subnet.foo.id, aws_subnet.bar.id]
}

resource "aws_wafregional_web_acl_association" "foo_waf" {
  resource_arn = aws_alb.fooooo.arn
  web_acl_id   = aws_wafregional_web_acl.foo.id
}
