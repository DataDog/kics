### Description

 Single Sign-On (SSO) permission sets should restrict user session durations to a maximum of one hour to reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access and session hijacking. Allowing longer session durations by setting the `session_duration` attribute to values such as `"PT2H"` or `"PT1H1M"` in the `aws_ssoadmin_permission_set` resource increases the risk of attackers leveraging stale or stolen sessions. Configuring session durations to `session_duration = "PT1H"`, or omitting the duration in the configuration enforces this security best practice and helps limit potential exposure.

  name             = "Example"
  instance_arn     = tolist(data.aws_ssoadmin_instances.example.arns)[0]
  relay_state      = "https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1//"
  session_duration = "PT1H"
}
```
