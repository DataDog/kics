## Metadata
**Name:** `aws/user_with_privilege_escalation_by_actions_iam_AttachRolePolicy`
**Query Name** `User With Privilege Escalation By Actions 'iam:AttachRolePolicy'`
**Id:** `e227091e-2228-4b40-b046-fc13650d8e88`
**Cloud Provider:** aws
**Platform** Terraform
**Severity:** Medium
**Category:** Access Control
## Description
Granting the `iam:AttachRolePolicy` action with a resource value of `"*"` allows the user to attach any policy to any IAM role, enabling privilege escalation if the user can attach policies granting additional permissions or even administrator-level access. This misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access across your AWS environment, as users may obtain permissions far beyond their original scope. To remediate, policy statements should scope the `Resource` field to only those roles and policies necessary for the userâ€™s legitimate activities, avoiding the use of a wildcard (`*`).
