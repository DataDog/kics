### Description

 It is a best practice for AWS security groups to include a meaningful `description` attribute in their Terraform configuration, such as in the following example:

```
description = "Allow TLS inbound traffic"
```

Omitting the description field, as shown below, can lead to confusion and hinder effective management or auditing of security groups, especially in environments with many resources:

```
resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
  name   = "allow_tls"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  // missing description
  ...
}
```

Without clear descriptions, security teams may struggle to quickly identify the purpose of a group, increasing the risk of misconfigurations and delayed incident response.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
  name        = "allow_tls"
  description = "Allow TLS inbound traffic"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description      = "TLS from VPC"
    from_port        = 443
    to_port          = 443
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = [aws_vpc.main.cidr_block]
    ipv6_cidr_blocks = [aws_vpc.main.ipv6_cidr_block]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "allow_tls"
  }
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
  name        = "allow_tls"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description      = "TLS from VPC"
    from_port        = 443
    to_port          = 443
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = [aws_vpc.main.cidr_block]
    ipv6_cidr_blocks = [aws_vpc.main.ipv6_cidr_block]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "allow_tls"
  }
}

```
