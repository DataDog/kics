### Description

 CloudTrail logs contain sensitive information about account activity and should be protected from unauthorized access. If the `kms_key_id` attribute is not specified in the `aws_cloudtrail` resource block, as shown in:

```
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "positive1" {
  name           = "npositive_1"
  s3_bucket_name = "bucketlog_1"
}
```

then the logs stored in S3 are not encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key, leaving them vulnerable to exposure or tampering. Using the `kms_key_id` attribute, as in:

```
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "negative1" {
  name           = "negative1"
  s3_bucket_name = "bucketlog1"
  kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
}
```

ensures that the logs are protected with strong encryption, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and helping meet compliance requirements.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "negative1" {
  name                          = "negative1"
  s3_bucket_name                = "bucketlog1"
  kms_key_id                    = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "positive1" {
  name                          = "npositive_1"
  s3_bucket_name                = "bucketlog_1"
}

```
