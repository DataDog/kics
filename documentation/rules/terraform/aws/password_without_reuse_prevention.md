## Metadata
**Name:** `aws/password_without_reuse_prevention`

**Cloud Provider:** aws
**Severity:** Low
**Category:** Best Practices
## Description
This check ensures that the IAM account password policy's `password_reuse_prevention` attribute is set to at least 24, preventing users from reusing any of their last 24 passwords. Without this configuration, as seen when `password_reuse_prevention = 20` or when the attribute is omitted, users may repeatedly cycle through a small set of previously used passwords, increasing the risk of password-related attacks. Configuring a secure password policy such as:

```
resource "aws_iam_account_password_policy" "secure" {
  minimum_password_length        = 8
  require_lowercase_characters   = true
  require_numbers                = true
  require_uppercase_characters   = true
  require_symbols                = true
  allow_users_to_change_password = true
  password_reuse_prevention      = 24
}
```

helps to enforce strong password hygiene and mitigates the likelihood of compromised credentials being reused.
