## Metadata
**Name:** `aws/s3_bucket_without_ignore_public_acl`
**Id:** `4fa66806-0dd9-4f8d-9480-3174d39c7c91`
**Cloud Provider:** aws
**Severity:** Medium
**Category:** Insecure Configurations
## Description
When the `ignore_public_acls` attribute in the `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` resource is set to `false`, S3 buckets may still honor any public access permissions granted by existing or future bucket or object ACLs. This creates a risk of sensitive data being inadvertently exposed to the public internet if a user or process applies a permissive ACL. To prevent this, `ignore_public_acls` should be set to `true`, which ensures that all public ACLs are ignored and cannot be used to grant public access.
