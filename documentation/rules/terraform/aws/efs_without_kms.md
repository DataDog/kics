### Description

 This check ensures that Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) resources are configured with encryption enabled using a customer-managed KMS key specified via the `kms_key_id` attribute, rather than defaulting to AWS-managed keys. If only `encrypted = true` is set without specifying a `kms_key_id`, sensitive data stored in EFS will use default AWS-managed encryption keys, reducing control over key rotation and access management. Failure to use a customer-managed key increases the risk of unauthorized data access and may not meet stringent compliance requirements for sensitive workloads.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "negative1" {
  creation_token = "my-product"
  encrypted = true
  kms_key_id = "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

  tags = {
    Name = "MyProduct"
  }
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "positive1" {
  creation_token = "my-product"
  encrypted = true

  tags = {
    Name = "MyProduct"
  }
}
```
