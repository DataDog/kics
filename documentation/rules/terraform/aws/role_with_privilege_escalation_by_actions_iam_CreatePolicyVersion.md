### Description

 Granting the `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` action with a resource of `"*"` in an IAM policy allows a user to create new policy versions for *any* policy in the AWS account, including those attached to highly privileged roles. This capability can be exploited for privilege escalation, as a malicious or compromised user could attach or update policies to grant themselves broader permissions. To mitigate this risk, restrict the `Resource` attribute to specific policy ARNs and only grant this action to trusted administrative principals.

A more secure configuration would specify only necessary actions for the specific resources required, for example:

```
resource "aws_iam_user" "cosmic2" {
  name = "cosmic2"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "inline_policy_run_instances2" {
  name = "inline_policy_run_instances"
  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
```


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "cosmic2" {
  name = "cosmic2"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "inline_policy_run_instances2" {
  name = "inline_policy_run_instances"
  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_iam_role" "cosmic" {
  name = "cosmic"
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "test_inline_policy" {
  name = "test_inline_policy"
  role = aws_iam_role.cosmic.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "iam:CreatePolicyVersion",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
