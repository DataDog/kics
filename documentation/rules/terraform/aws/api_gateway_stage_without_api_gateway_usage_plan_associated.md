### Description

 API Gateway stages should always be associated with an API Gateway UsagePlan, which enforces throttling and quota limits for clients accessing your APIs. Without a defined `aws_api_gateway_usage_plan` resource and its association via the `api_stages` block, as shown below,

```
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "example" {
  deployment_id = "some deployment id"
  rest_api_id   = "some rest api id"
  stage_name    = "development"
}
```

the API stage can be accessed without usage restrictions, leading to potential misuse, abuse, or denial of service due to unlimited traffic. Configuring a UsagePlan like

```
resource "aws_api_gateway_usage_plan" "example" {
  name        = "my-usage-plan"
  description = "usage plan description"
  api_stages {
    api_id = "some rest api id"
    stage  = "development"
  }
}
```

helps mitigate these risks by controlling consumption through quotas and throttling, protecting backend resources and maintaining predictable API performance.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "negative1" {
  deployment_id = "some deployment id"
  rest_api_id   = "rest_api_1"
  stage_name    = "development"
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_usage_plan" "negative2" {
  name         = "my-usage-plan"
  description  = "my description"
  product_code = "MYCODE"

  api_stages {
    api_id = "rest_api_1"
    stage  = "development"
  }
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "positive1" {
  rest_api_id   = "some deployment id"
  deployment_id = "some rest api id"
  stage_name = "some name"
  tags {
    project = "ProjectName"
  }
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_stage" "positive2" {
  deployment_id = "some deployment id"
  rest_api_id   = "some rest api id"
  stage_name    = "development"
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_usage_plan" "positive3" {
  name         = "my-usage-plan"
  description  = "my description"
  product_code = "MYCODE"

  api_stages {
    api_id = "another id"
    stage  = "development"
  }
}

```
