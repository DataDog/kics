### Description

 This check verifies whether the Amazon Organizations configuration has the `feature_set` attribute set to `"ALL"`, which enables all features, including the use of Service Control Policies (SCPs). If `feature_set` is set only to `"CONSOLIDATED_BILLING"`, as in the following example, then organizations cannot use SCPs for centralized governance, making it difficult to enforce security and compliance policies across AWS accounts:

```
resource "aws_organizations_organization" "example" {
  feature_set = "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING"
}
```

This leaves accounts within the organization more vulnerable to misconfigurations and unauthorized access, as critical controls cannot be imposed at the organization level.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_organizations_organization" "negative1" {
  aws_service_access_principals = [
    "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com",
    "config.amazonaws.com",
  ]

  feature_set = "ALL"
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_organizations_organization" "positive1" {
  aws_service_access_principals = [
    "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com",
    "config.amazonaws.com",
  ]

  feature_set = "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING"
}

```
