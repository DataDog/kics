### Description

 When creating an AWS KMS key using Terraform, the `deletion_window_in_days` attribute specifies the waiting period before a key is permanently deleted after a deletion request. If this attribute is not set or is configured with an excessively high value, such as `deletion_window_in_days = 31`, it can delay key deletion and increase exposure to accidental or malicious use if a compromised key remains active for longer than necessary. Setting a minimal but valid window, such as `deletion_window_in_days = 10`, reduces this risk by ensuring that keys are deleted more promptly after they are scheduled for removal.

```
resource "aws_kms_key" "negative1" {
  description             = "KMS key 1"

  is_enabled = true

  enable_key_rotation = true

  deletion_window_in_days = 10
}
```


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_kms_key" "negative1" {
  description             = "KMS key 1"
  
  is_enabled = true

  enable_key_rotation = true

  deletion_window_in_days = 10
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_kms_key" "positive1" {
  description             = "KMS key 1"
  
  is_enabled = true

  enable_key_rotation = true

}


resource "aws_kms_key" "positive2" {
  description             = "KMS key 1"
  
  is_enabled = true

  enable_key_rotation = true

  deletion_window_in_days = 31
}

```
