### Description

 When defining an `aws_cloudformation_stack_set_instance` resource in Terraform, it is important to set the `retain_stack` attribute to `true`. If `retain_stack` is set to `false` or omitted (the default value is `false`), the underlying CloudFormation stack and all associated resources will be deleted when the stack set instance is destroyed or removed from the configuration. This creates a risk of accidental and irreversible data loss, as resources could be unintentionally deleted during operations such as stack set updates, deletions, or when Terraform destroy is executed. Ensuring that `retain_stack` is enabled (`retain_stack = true`) helps protect critical infrastructure by leaving the stack and its resources intact even after the stack set instance is removed, allowing for manual intervention or recovery if needed.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_cloudformation_stack_set_instance" "negative1" {
  account_id     = "123456789012"
  region         = "us-east-1"
  stack_set_name = aws_cloudformation_stack_set.example.name
  retain_stack     = true
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_cloudformation_stack_set_instance" "positive1" {
  account_id     = "123456789012"
  region         = "us-east-1"
  stack_set_name = aws_cloudformation_stack_set.example.name
  retain_stack   = false
}

resource "aws_cloudformation_stack_set_instance" "positive2" {
  account_id     = "123456789012"
  region         = "us-east-1"
  stack_set_name = aws_cloudformation_stack_set.example.name
}
```
