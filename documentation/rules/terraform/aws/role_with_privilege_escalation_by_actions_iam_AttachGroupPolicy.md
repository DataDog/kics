### Description

 Granting the action `iam:AttachGroupPolicy` with the resource set to `*` in an AWS IAM role allows the entity to attach any group policy to any group in the AWS account, providing a path to privilege escalation. An attacker with this permission could leverage it to assign powerful permissions to groups they control or are a member of, thereby elevating their own privileges or those of other malicious accounts. If left unaddressed, this misconfiguration can result in unauthorized access or complete compromise of AWS resources, posing a serious security risk. It is critical to restrict the `iam:AttachGroupPolicy` action to specific, trusted resources and avoid using overly broad permissions in IAM policies.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "cosmic2" {
  name = "cosmic2"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "inline_policy_run_instances2" {
  name = "inline_policy_run_instances"
  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_iam_role" "cosmic" {
  name = "cosmic"
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "test_inline_policy" {
  name = "test_inline_policy"
  role = aws_iam_role.cosmic.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "iam:AttachGroupPolicy",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
