## Metadata
**Name:** `aws/user_with_privilege_escalation_by_actions_iam_AttachUserPolicy`
**Id:** `70cb518c-d990-46f6-bc05-44a5041493d6`
**Cloud Provider:** aws
**Severity:** Medium
**Category:** Access Control
## Description
This check identifies IAM policies that permit the action `iam:AttachUserPolicy` with the `Resource` field set to `"*"`. Granting this permission to a user, as shown below, allows them to attach any AWS managed or custom policy to any user, which can lead to privilege escalation and potential compromise of the AWS environment.

```
policy = jsonencode({
  Version = "2012-10-17"
  Statement = [
    {
      Action = [
        "iam:AttachUserPolicy",
      ]
      Effect   = "Allow"
      Resource = "*"
    },
  ]
})
```

If left unaddressed, an attacker with this permission could escalate their privileges far beyond what was originally intended, potentially gaining administrative access and leading to a full environment takeover.
