### Description

 This check ensures that Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) clusters are deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by specifying a `subnet_id` in the Terraform resource. Launching EMR clusters without associating them to a VPC, as shown by omitting the `subnet_id` attribute in the `aws_emr_cluster` resource, exposes the cluster to public networks and increases the risk of unauthorized access or data compromise. By deploying EMR clusters in a VPC, network access control can be properly enforced through security groups and network ACLs, limiting exposure to only trusted sources. Failure to launch EMR clusters inside a VPC can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, or service disruption.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_emr_cluster" "negative1" {
  name          = "emr-test-arn"
  release_label = "emr-4.6.0"
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.main.id
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "aws_emr_cluster" "positive1" {
  name          = "emr-test-arn"
  release_label = "emr-4.6.0"
}

```
