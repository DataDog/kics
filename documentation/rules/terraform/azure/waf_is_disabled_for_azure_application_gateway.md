### Description

 This check ensures that the Azure Application Gateway has its Web Application Firewall (WAF) correctly configured and enabled, as indicated by the `waf_configuration { enabled = true }` attribute in Terraform. If WAF is not enabled or omitted from the configuration, the application gateway is left unprotected against common web attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, increasing the risk of a successful attack. To mitigate this vulnerability, always configure WAF with `enabled = true` as shown below:

```
resource "azurerm_application_gateway" "example" {
  // ... other settings ...
  waf_configuration {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "azurerm_application_gateway" "negative1" {
  name                = "example-appgateway"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  waf_configuration {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "azurerm_application_gateway" "positive1" {
  name                = "example-appgateway"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  waf_configuration {
    enabled = false
  }
}

resource "azurerm_application_gateway" "positive2" {
  name                = "example-appgateway"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
}
```
