### Description

 Azure Security Center contact alert notifications should be enabled to ensure that designated security contacts receive email alerts about security issues or threats in your Azure environment. If the `alert_notifications` attribute is set to `false`, such as in 

```
resource "azurerm_security_center_contact" "example" {
    email = "contact@example.com"
    phone = "+1-555-555-5555"
    alert_notifications = false
}
```

critical security incidents could go unnoticed, increasing the risk of delayed response to threats. Setting `alert_notifications = true` ensures timely awareness and response to potential security incidents.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "azurerm_security_center_contact" "negative1" {
    email = "contact@example.com"
    phone = "+1-555-555-5555"
    alert_notifications = true
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "azurerm_security_center_contact" "positive1" {
    email = "contact@example.com"
    phone = "+1-555-555-5555"
   alert_notifications = false
}
```
