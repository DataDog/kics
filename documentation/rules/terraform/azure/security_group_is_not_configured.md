### Description

 Network Security Groups (NSGs) in Azure provide filtering of network traffic to and from Azure resources within an Azure Virtual Network. When a subnet is not configured with an NSG, it lacks essential security controls that filter inbound and outbound traffic, potentially exposing resources to unauthorized access and network-based attacks. 

A properly secured Virtual Network requires the 'security_group' attribute to be defined with a valid NSG reference in each subnet configuration. Without this protection, workloads running in these subnets may be accessible from unwanted network sources, increasing the attack surface.

Secure example:
```terraform
subnet {
  name           = "subnet1"
  address_prefix = "10.1.2.0/25"
  security_group = "securitygroup-name"
}
```

Vulnerable example:
```terraform
subnet {
  name           = "subnet1"
  address_prefix = "10.1.2.0/25"
  // Missing security_group attribute
}
```


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
#this code is a correct code for which the query should not find any result
resource "azure_virtual_network" "negative1" {
  name          = "test-network"
  address_space = ["10.1.2.0/24"]
  location      = "West US"

  subnet {
    name           = "subnet1"
    address_prefix = "10.1.2.0/25"
    security_group = "a"
  }
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
#this is a problematic code where the query should report a result(s)
resource "azure_virtual_network" "positive1" {
  name          = "test-network"
  address_space = ["10.1.2.0/24"]
  location      = "West US"

  subnet {
    name           = "subnet1"
    address_prefix = "10.1.2.0/25"
  }
}

resource "azure_virtual_network" "positive2" {
  name          = "test-network"
  address_space = ["10.1.2.0/24"]
  location      = "West US"

  subnet {
    name           = "subnet1"
    address_prefix = "10.1.2.0/25"
    security_group = ""
  }
}
```
