### Description

 Selecting the appropriate pricing tier for Azure Security Center is crucial for ensuring comprehensive security monitoring and protection. If the `tier` attribute in the `azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing` resource is set to `"Free"`, as in the following configuration, only limited security features and monitoring capabilities are enabled, leaving the environment more vulnerable to threats:

```
resource "azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing" "example" {
   tier = "Free"
}
```

To enhance security coverage, upgrade to the `"Standard"` tier, as shown below. This enables advanced features such as threat detection and automated response, significantly reducing the risk of undetected attacks and data breaches:

```
resource "azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing" "example" {
   tier = "Standard"
}
```




## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing" "negative1" {
   tier = "Standard"
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing" "positive1" {
   tier = "Free"
}
```
