### Description

 To ensure data transmitted to and from Azure Storage Accounts remains protected, it is important to enforce the use of the latest supported TLS encryption protocol. If the `min_tls_version` attribute is set to an outdated protocol such as `"TLS1_1"`, as seen below, the storage account may be vulnerable to known security exploits:

```
  min_tls_version = "TLS1_1"
```

To mitigate this risk, configure storage accounts to use at least TLS 1.2 by setting:

```
  min_tls_version = "TLS1_2"
```

Failing to enforce modern TLS versions can expose sensitive data in transit to interception or tampering by attackers.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "negative1" {
  name                     = "storageaccountname"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
  min_tls_version = "TLS1_2"

  tags = {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}

```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "positive2" {
  name                     = "storageaccountname"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
  min_tls_version = "TLS1_1"

  tags = {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}

```
