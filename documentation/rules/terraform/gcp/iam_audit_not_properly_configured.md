### Description

 A defective audit logging configuration in Terraform, as defined by the `google_project_iam_audit_config` resource, can lead to incomplete or incorrect logging of critical activities within your cloud environment. For example, omitting required `log_type` values or specifying exempted members, as shown below, allows certain user actions to go unrecorded, potentially bypassing audit trails and hampering incident investigations:

```
resource "google_project_iam_audit_config" "example" {
  project = "your-project-id"
  service = "allServices"
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "DATA_READ"
    exempted_members = ["user:joebloggs@hashicorp.com"]
  }
}
```

Without comprehensive audit logs, organizations may be unable to detect or investigate unauthorized access or changes, increasing the risk of undetected misuse or data breaches. A secure configuration should ensure that all required log types (such as `ADMIN_READ` and `DATA_READ`) are enabled and that no users or accounts are unnecessarily exempted from logging.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "google_project_iam_audit_config" "negative1" {
  project = "your-project-id"
  service = "allServices"
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "ADMIN_READ"
  }
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "DATA_READ"
  }
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "google_project_iam_audit_config" "positive1" {
  project = "your-project-id"
  service = "some_specific_service"
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "ADMIN_READ"
  }
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "DATA_READ"
    exempted_members = [
      "user:joebloggs@hashicorp.com"
    ]
  }
}

resource "google_project_iam_audit_config" "positive2" {
  project = "your-project-id"
  service = "allServices"
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "INVALID_TYPE"
  }
  audit_log_config {
    log_type = "DATA_READ"
    exempted_members = [
        "user:joebloggs@hashicorp.com"
    ]
  }
}
```
