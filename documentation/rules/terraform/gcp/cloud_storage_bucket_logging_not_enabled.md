### Description

 Cloud storage buckets should have logging enabled to capture access and usage data for auditing and monitoring purposes. If the `logging` block is not configured in the Terraform resource, access to and modifications of storage objects may go unnoticed, making it difficult to detect unauthorized activities or investigate security incidents.

A secure configuration includes a `logging` block, as shown below:

```
resource "google_storage_bucket" "auto_expiring_bucket" {
  name          = "auto-expiring-bucket"
  location      = "US"
  force_destroy = true

  logging {
    logBucket = "example-logs-bucket"
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    condition {
      age = 3
    }
    action {
      type = "Delete"
    }
  }
}
```

Enabling logging helps improve visibility into data access and can aid in compliance efforts.


## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "google_storage_bucket" "negative1" {
  name          = "auto-expiring-bucket"
  location      = "US"
  force_destroy = true

  logging {
	logBucket = "example-logs-bucket"
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    condition {
      age = 3
    }
    action {
      type = "Delete"
    }
  }
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "google_storage_bucket" "positive1" {
  name          = "auto-expiring-bucket"
  location      = "US"
  force_destroy = true

  lifecycle_rule {
    condition {
      age = 3
    }
    action {
      type = "Delete"
    }
  }
}

```
