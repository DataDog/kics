## Metadata
**Name:** `gcp/cloud_storage_bucket_is_publicly_accessible`
**Query Name** `Cloud Storage Bucket Is Publicly Accessible`
**Id:** `c010082c-76e0-4b91-91d9-6e8439e455dd`
**Cloud Provider:** gcp
**Platform** Terraform
**Severity:** Medium
**Category:** Access Control
## Description
Granting public or anonymous access to a Google Cloud Storage bucket using Terraform, such as setting the `member` to `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers` in a `google_storage_bucket_iam_member` resource, exposes your data to anyone on the internet or any authenticated Google account, respectively. This can lead to data leaks, theft, or manipulation since anyone could potentially view, download, modify, or delete sensitive data. To prevent this, IAM bindings for storage buckets should only specify trusted user or service accounts, as shown below:

```
resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "secure_example" {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name
  role   = "roles/storage.admin"
  member = "user:jane@example.com"
}
```

## Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "negative1" {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name
  role = "roles/storage.admin"
  member = "user:jane@example.com"
}


resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "negative2" {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name
  role = "roles/storage.admin"
  members = ["user:john@example.com","user:john@example.com"]
}
```
## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```terraform
resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "positive1" {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name
  role = "roles/storage.admin"
  member = "allUsers"

  condition {
    title       = "expires_after_2019_12_31"
    description = "Expiring at midnight of 2019-12-31"
    expression  = "request.time < timestamp(\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\")"
  }
}


resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "positive2" {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name
  role = "roles/storage.admin"
  members = ["user:john@example.com","allAuthenticatedUsers"]
}
