  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the IAM account password policy's `password_reuse_prevention` attribute is set to at least 24, preventing users from reusing any of their last 24 passwords. Without this configuration, as seen when `password_reuse_prevention = 20` or when the attribute is omitted, users may repeatedly cycle through a small set of previously used passwords, increasing the risk of password-related attacks. Configuring a secure password policy such as:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_account_password_policy\" \"secure\" {\n  minimum_password_length        = 8\n  require_lowercase_characters   = true\n  require_numbers                = true\n  require_uppercase_characters   = true\n  require_symbols                = true\n  allow_users_to_change_password = true\n  password_reuse_prevention      = 24\n}\n```\n\nhelps to enforce strong password hygiene and mitigates the likelihood of compromised credentials being reused.",
