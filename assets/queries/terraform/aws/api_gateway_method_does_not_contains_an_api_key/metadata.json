  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "When defining an `aws_api_gateway_method` resource in Terraform, it is critical to require an API key on method requests by setting the attribute `api_key_required = true`. If this option is set to `false` or omitted (as shown below), unauthorized clients can invoke the API method without providing an API key, exposing the endpoint to potential abuse and unauthorized access.\n\n```\nresource \"aws_api_gateway_method\" \"insecure_example\" {\n  rest_api_id      = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.MyDemoAPI.id\n  resource_id      = aws_api_gateway_resource.MyDemoResource.id\n  http_method      = \"GET\"\n  authorization    = \"NONE\"\n  api_key_required = false\n}\n```\n\nFailing to enforce API key requirements can lead to security risks such as credential-less access to sensitive endpoints, excessive traffic, and increased risk of denial-of-service attacks.",
