  "descriptionText": "Amazon MQ brokers should have encryption options defined to ensure messages are encrypted at rest. Without proper encryption, sensitive data in message queues could be exposed if storage is compromised.

Example of secure configuration: `encryption_options { kms_key_id = \"your-kms-key-arn\" use_aws_owned_key = false }` or simply `encryption_options {}` to use AWS-owned keys.",
