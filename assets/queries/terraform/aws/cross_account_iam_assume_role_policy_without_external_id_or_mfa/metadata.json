      "descriptionText": "When creating cross-account IAM roles, it's crucial to implement additional security measures like External ID or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized cross-account access. Without these safeguards, your resources become vulnerable to confused deputy attacks, where a malicious third party could trick your role into performing actions they shouldn't be authorized to do. To secure your configuration, add a Condition block to your assume role policy that requires either an External ID (as shown in the example below) or MFA validation:\n\n```json\n\"Condition\": {\n  \"StringEquals\": {\n    \"sts:ExternalId\": \"98765\"\n  }\n}\n```"
