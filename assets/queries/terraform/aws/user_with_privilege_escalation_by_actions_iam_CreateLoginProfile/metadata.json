  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Allowing users the `iam:CreateLoginProfile` action with the `Resource` set to `\"*\"` in AWS IAM policies permits them to set a password for any IAM user, thereby enabling direct console access. This creates a privilege escalation vulnerability, as the user can potentially assign login profiles to high-privilege accounts, leading to unauthorized access and control over critical AWS resources. To mitigate this risk, restrict the `Resource` to specific user ARNs and avoid assigning broad permissions, as shown in the following secure Terraform configuration:\n\n```\npolicy = jsonencode({\n  Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n  Statement = [\n    {\n      Action = [\n        \"ec2:Describe*\",\n      ]\n      Effect   = \"Allow\"\n      Resource = \"*\"\n    },\n  ]\n})\n```",
