  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Granting the `iam:AttachRolePolicy` action with a resource value of `\"*\"` allows the user to attach any policy to any IAM role, enabling privilege escalation if the user can attach policies granting additional permissions or even administrator-level access. This misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access across your AWS environment, as users may obtain permissions far beyond their original scope. To remediate, policy statements should scope the `Resource` field to only those roles and policies necessary for the userâ€™s legitimate activities, avoiding the use of a wildcard (`*`).",
