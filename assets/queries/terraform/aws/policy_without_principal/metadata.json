  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "When defining resource-based policies in AWS using Terraform, the `Principal` element must be explicitly set to specify which users, roles, or accounts are permitted to access the resource. If the `Principal` element is omitted in policies other than IAM identity-based policies, the permissions may unintentionally allow access to any AWS user, potentially enabling unauthorized or malicious actions on the resource. For example, a secure policy includes the `\"Principal\"` attribute, restricting permissions to specific users:\n\n```\n\"Principal\": {\n  \"AWS\": [\n    \"arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:user/user-name-1\",\n    \"arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:user/UserName2\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nNeglecting to define the `Principal` in resource-based policies significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.",
