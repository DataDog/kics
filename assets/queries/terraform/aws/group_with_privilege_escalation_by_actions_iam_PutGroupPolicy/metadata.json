  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "This check identifies IAM group policies that grant the action `iam:PutGroupPolicy` with a resource set to `\"*\"`, allowing anyone in the group to attach arbitrary inline policies to any IAM group. This presents a privilege escalation risk, as users with this permission could assign themselves broader or unauthorized permissions by updating policies on other groups. To mitigate this, restrict the `Action` and `Resource` fields in policies and avoid assigning sensitive permissions to groups broadly.\n\nA secure Terraform configuration should limit permissions to only what is necessary. For example:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_user_policy\" \"inline_policy_run_instances2\" {\n  name = \"inline_policy_run_instances\"\n  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name\n\n  policy = jsonencode({\n    Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n    Statement = [\n      {\n        Action = [\n          \"ec2:Describe*\",\n        ]\n        Effect   = \"Allow\"\n        Resource = \"*\"\n      },\n    ]\n  })\n}\n```",
