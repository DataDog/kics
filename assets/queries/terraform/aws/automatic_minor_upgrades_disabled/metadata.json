  "descriptionText": "RDS instances in AWS should have automatic minor version upgrades enabled by setting the `auto_minor_version_upgrade` attribute to `true`. This ensures that the database receives timely security patches and important bug fixes without manual intervention. If this attribute is set to `false`, as shown in the following configuration, the RDS instance will not automatically apply minor updates, potentially leaving it exposed to vulnerabilities and unsupported bugs until manually updated.\n\n```\nauto_minor_version_upgrade = false\n```\n\nThis increases the risk of security incidents and database outages due to missed critical patches.",
