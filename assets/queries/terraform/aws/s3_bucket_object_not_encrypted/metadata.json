  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "S3 Bucket Object should have server-side encryption enabled",
  "detailedDescriptionText": "This check verifies that S3 bucket objects have server-side encryption enabled to protect sensitive data at rest. Unencrypted S3 objects could expose confidential information if unauthorized access occurs, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. Server-side encryption is a critical security control that should be implemented for all objects stored in S3 buckets.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs when the 'server_side_encryption' attribute is missing in an aws_s3_bucket_object resource as shown in this insecure example:\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket_object\" \"examplebucket_object\" {\n  key    = \"someobject\"\n  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.examplebucket.id\n  source = \"index.html\"\n}\n```\n\nTo remediate this issue, add the 'server_side_encryption' attribute with an appropriate encryption algorithm such as 'AES256' or 'aws:kms':\n```hcl\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket_object\" \"examplebucket_object\" {\n  key                    = \"someobject\"\n  bucket                 = aws_s3_bucket.examplebucket.id\n  source                 = \"index.html\"\n  server_side_encryption = \"AES256\"\n}\n```",
