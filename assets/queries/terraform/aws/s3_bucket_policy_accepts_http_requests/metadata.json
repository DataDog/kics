  "descriptionText": "S3 bucket policies should explicitly deny unencrypted (HTTP) requests by using the `\"Condition\": { \"Bool\": { \"aws:SecureTransport\": \"false\" } }` block. Without this condition, users can transmit sensitive data over unencrypted HTTP connections, exposing objects in the bucket to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. To ensure all traffic uses HTTPS, set the following policy condition:\n\n```\n\"Condition\": {\n  \"Bool\": {\n    \"aws:SecureTransport\": \"false\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThis prevents insecure access and protects data integrity during transmission.",
