  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Using the `aws_identitystore_user` resource in Terraform to create AWS SSO users directly can result in misalignment between your AWS identities and external Identity Providers (IdPs) such as Active Directory. Because these users are not automatically synchronized with external directories, this configuration can introduce inconsistencies, orphaned accounts, or the risk of unauthorized access if users are not properly managed or deprovisioned. If left unaddressed, this may compromise the integrity of access controls and leave your AWS environment vulnerable to privilege escalation or account misuse.",

  "oldDescriptionText": "The use of AWS SSO for creating users may pose a security risk as it does not synchronize with external Identity Providers (IdP) or Active Directory (AD). This can lead to inconsistencies and potential unauthorized access to resources. It is recommended to review and update user creation processes to ensure proper security protocols are in place."
