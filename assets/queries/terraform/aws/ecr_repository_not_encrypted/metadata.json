  "severity": "LOW",
  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories should use customer-managed AWS KMS keys for encryption to ensure stronger access control, auditing, and compliance with organizational security requirements. By default, ECR repositories may only use AES256 encryption or omit the `encryption_configuration` block, which limits key management capabilities and centralized control over key lifecycle and access policies. A secure Terraform configuration example specifies a KMS key:\n\n```\nencryption_configuration {\n  encryption_type = \"KMS\"\n  kms_key = \"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab\"\n}\n```\n\nWithout this, sensitive container images may be at greater risk of unauthorized access or inability to meet regulatory requirements for key rotation and audit.",
