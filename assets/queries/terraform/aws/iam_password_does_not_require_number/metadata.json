  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the AWS IAM account password policy enforces the use of at least one symbol in user passwords by verifying that the `require_symbols` attribute is set to `true` in the `aws_iam_account_password_policy` resource. If this setting is not enabled, as shown in the configuration `require_symbols = false`, users may set simple passwords that lack special characters, making them easier for attackers to guess or crack using brute-force techniques.\n\nPasswords without symbols significantly reduce the complexity and entropy of user credentials, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to AWS accounts and resources. Enforcing passwords with symbols enhances overall account security by making passwords more resistant to common password attacks. If this configuration is left unaddressed, the AWS environment may be exposed to increased risk of compromise due to weak password practices.",
