  "queryName": "IAM Password Policy Does Not Require Symbol",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Best Practices",
  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the AWS IAM account password policy enforces the use of at least one symbol in user passwords by setting `require_symbols = true`. If `require_symbols` is set to `false`, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_account_password_policy\" \"bad_example\" {\n  minimum_password_length      = 14\n  require_symbols              = false\n  require_numbers              = true\n  require_lowercase_characters = true\n  require_uppercase_characters = true\n}\n```\n\nit weakens password complexity, making user accounts more susceptible to brute-force or password guessing attacks. Failing to enforce symbol usage increases the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources.",
