  "descriptionText": "Enabling Neptune logging ensures that audit and error logs are exported to Amazon CloudWatch, which is critical for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security auditing of Neptune database activity. If the `enable_cloudwatch_logs_exports` attribute is not set with values such as `[\"audit\"]` or `[\"audit\", \"error\"]`, as shown below, no logs will be exported by default, leaving potentially malicious or unauthorized database actions undetected:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_neptune_cluster\" \"example\" {\n  ...\n  enable_cloudwatch_logs_exports = [\"audit\", \"error\"]\n}\n```\n\nWithout these logs, it becomes challenging to investigate incidents, meet compliance requirements, or identify operational issues, increasing the risk of undetected attacks or data breaches.",
