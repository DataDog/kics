  "descriptionText": "Ensuring strong AWS IAM password security involves configuring both the `password_length` and `password_reset_required` attributes in the `aws_iam_user_login_profile` resource. Failing to set a sufficient `password_length` or omitting the `password_reset_required = true` option, as shown below,\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_user_login_profile\" \"example\" {\n  user    = aws_iam_user.example.name\n  pgp_key = \"keybase:some_person_that_exists\"\n  password_length = 13\n  password_reset_required = false\n}\n```\n\ncan lead to accounts being protected by weak or reused passwords, which increases the risk of unauthorized access. By requiring users to reset passwords on first use and enforcing adequate password length, as in\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_user_login_profile\" \"example\" {\n  user    = aws_iam_user.example.name\n  pgp_key = \"keybase:some_person_that_exists\"\n  password_length = 15\n  password_reset_required = true\n}\n```\n\norganizations can better defend against brute-force attacks and reduce credential compromise risk.",
