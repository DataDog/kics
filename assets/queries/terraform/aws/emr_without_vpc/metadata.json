  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) clusters are deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by specifying a `subnet_id` in the Terraform resource. Launching EMR clusters without associating them to a VPC, as shown by omitting the `subnet_id` attribute in the `aws_emr_cluster` resource, exposes the cluster to public networks and increases the risk of unauthorized access or data compromise. By deploying EMR clusters in a VPC, network access control can be properly enforced through security groups and network ACLs, limiting exposure to only trusted sources. Failure to launch EMR clusters inside a VPC can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, or service disruption.",
