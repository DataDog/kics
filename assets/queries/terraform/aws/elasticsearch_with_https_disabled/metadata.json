If `enforce_https` is left set to `false`, as shown below, communication with the Elasticsearch domain can occur over unencrypted HTTP, exposing data to interception and increasing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n```\ndomain_endpoint_options {\n  enforce_https = false\n}\n```\n\nTo mitigate this, always configure:\n\n```\ndomain_endpoint_options {\n  enforce_https = true\n}\n```\n\nEnforcing HTTPS ensures that all data transmitted between clients and the Elasticsearch service is encrypted, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.",
