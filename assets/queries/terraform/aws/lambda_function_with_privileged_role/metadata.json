  "descriptionText": "AWS Lambda functions with privileged IAM roles present a significant security risk by violating the principle of least privilege. When Lambda functions are assigned roles with broad permissions such as `iam:*` or `sts:AssumeRole`, they become potential vectors for privilege escalation if compromised. Instead, Lambda functions should be granted only the specific permissions needed for their execution.\n\nFor example, avoid policies with broad permissions like:\n```\npolicy = jsonencode({\n  Statement = [{\n    Action = [\n      \"ec2:Describe*\",\n      \"iam:*\"\n    ],\n    Effect   = \"Allow\",\n    Resource = \"*\"\n  }]\n})\n```\n\nInstead, implement least privilege permissions:\n```\npolicy = jsonencode({\n  Statement = [{\n    Action = [\n      \"ec2:Describe*\",\n      \"s3:GetObject\"\n    ],\n    Effect   = \"Allow\",\n    Resource = \"*\"\n  }]\n})\n```",
