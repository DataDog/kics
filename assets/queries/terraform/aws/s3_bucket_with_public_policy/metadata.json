  "descriptionText": "S3 buckets should block public policies to prevent unauthorized access to bucket contents. When the `block_public_policy` attribute is set to false or not defined in the `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` resource, attackers could potentially attach public policies to the bucket, exposing sensitive data to the internet. To secure your S3 bucket, ensure that `block_public_policy` is set to `true`, as shown in the following example:\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id\n  block_public_acls   = true\n  block_public_policy = true\n  ignore_public_acls  = false\n}\n```",
