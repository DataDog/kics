      "descriptionText": "Granting the `iam:UpdateLoginProfile` action with the `Resource` attribute set to `\"*\"` in an IAM policy allows a role or user to change the login passwords of any IAM user in the AWS account. This creates a privilege escalation vulnerability, as a user with this permission could take over other accounts and gain unauthorized access to critical resources. \n\nTo prevent this, use least-privilege access—for example, restricting allowed actions and resource scope, as in:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_user_policy\" \"inline_policy_run_instances2\" {\n  name = \"inline_policy_run_instances\"\n  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name\n\n  policy = jsonencode({\n    Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n    Statement = [\n      {\n        Action = [\n          \"ec2:Describe*\",\n        ]\n        Effect   = \"Allow\"\n        Resource = \"*\"\n      },\n    ]\n  })\n}\n```\nThis sample policy grants only read-only access to EC2 information, rather than sensitive IAM actions."
