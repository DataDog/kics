  "descriptionText": "Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues should use Server-Side Encryption (SSE) to protect the contents of their messages while at rest. Without specifying the `kms_master_key_id` attribute in the Terraform configuration (e.g., `resource \"aws_sqs_queue\" \"positive1\"`), messages sent to the queue are stored without encryption, exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access if AWS infrastructure is compromised. Enabling SSE by setting `kms_master_key_id` (as shown below) ensures that all messages are encrypted using a customer-managed key, significantly reducing the risk of data leakage.\n\n```\nresource \"aws_sqs_queue\" \"example\" {\n  name                  = \"terraform-example-queue\"\n  kms_master_key_id     = \"alias/aws/sqs\"\n  kms_data_key_reuse_period_seconds = 300\n}\n```",
