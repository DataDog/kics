  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the `endpoint_configuration.types` attribute for `aws_api_gateway_rest_api` resources is set to `\"PRIVATE\"`, rather than `\"REGIONAL\"` or `\"EDGE\"`. By exposing API Gateway endpoints to the public internet (e.g., with `\"REGIONAL\"`), sensitive services can be accessed or exploited by unauthorized parties. Setting the endpoint type to `\"PRIVATE\"` restricts access to only sources within your VPC, mitigating the risk of data exposure or malicious traffic.\n\n```\nresource \"aws_api_gateway_rest_api\" \"secure_example\" {\n  name = \"private-endpoint\"\n\n  endpoint_configuration {\n    types = [\"PRIVATE\"]\n  }\n}\n```",
