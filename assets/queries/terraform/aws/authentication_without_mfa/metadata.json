  "descriptionText": "Requiring users to authenticate using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security beyond just a password, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised. In Terraform, this can be enforced by using an IAM policy with a condition such as `\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": \"true\"`, which restricts permissions like `sts:AssumeRole` to only those sessions where MFA has been verified. Without this condition, as shown in the following policy snippet, the user may be able to access sensitive AWS resources without MFA: \n\n```\n\"Condition\": {\n  \"BoolIfExists\": {\n    \"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": \"false\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf left unaddressed, this misconfiguration could allow attackers with access to the user's credentials to escalate privileges or access critical resources without needing a second authentication factor, significantly increasing the risk of account compromise or data breach.",
