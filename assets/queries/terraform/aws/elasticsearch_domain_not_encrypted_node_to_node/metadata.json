  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "Enabling node-to-node encryption for an Elasticsearch domain ensures that data transferred between nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster is securely encrypted, preventing unauthorized access to data in transit. If the `node_to_node_encryption` block is omitted, sensitive data could be intercepted by attackers during communication between cluster nodes. To secure the domain, configure:\n\n```\nnode_to_node_encryption {\n  enabled = true\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that all internal communications within the cluster is encrypted, reducing the risk of data exposure.",
