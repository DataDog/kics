  "descriptionText": "A password expiration policy enforces regular password changes, reducing the risk of compromised credentials being exploited over long periods. If the `aws_iam_account_password_policy` resource does not set the `max_password_age` attribute, as shown below,\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_account_password_policy\" \"example\" {\n  minimum_password_length        = 8\n  require_lowercase_characters   = true\n  require_numbers                = true\n  require_uppercase_characters   = true\n  require_symbols                = true\n  allow_users_to_change_password = true\n  // max_password_age not set\n}\n```\n\npasswords may remain valid indefinitely, increasing the chance that leaked or weak passwords can be used for unauthorized access. This exposes your AWS environment to persistent credential-related threats if not addressed.",
