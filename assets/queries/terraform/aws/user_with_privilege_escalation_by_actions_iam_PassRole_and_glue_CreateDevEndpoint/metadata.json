  "queryName": "User With Privilege Escalation By Actions 'glue:CreateDevEndpoint' And 'iam:PassRole'",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Granting an IAM user permissions for both `glue:CreateDevEndpoint` and `iam:PassRole` actions with the `Resource` set to `\"*\"` allows that user to create a Glue development endpoint and attach any role in the account, including those with elevated privileges. This misconfiguration enables privilege escalation, meaning the user could effectively gain administrator-level access or perform unauthorized actions across the AWS environment. To prevent this, restrict the actions and resources in IAM policies and avoid using wildcard `\"*\"` permissions, as in the secure example below:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_user_policy\" \"inline_policy_limited\" {\n  name = \"inline_policy_limited\"\n  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name\n\n  policy = jsonencode({\n    Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n    Statement = [\n      {\n        Action = [\n          \"ec2:Describe*\",\n        ]\n        Effect   = \"Allow\"\n        Resource = \"*\"\n      },\n    ]\n  })\n}\n```",
