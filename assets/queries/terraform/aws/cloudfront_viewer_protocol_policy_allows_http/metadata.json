  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the connection between Amazon CloudFront and the viewer is encrypted by verifying the `viewer_protocol_policy` attribute. If set to `allow-all` (e.g., `viewer_protocol_policy = \"allow-all\"`), CloudFront can serve content over both HTTP and HTTPS, leaving data in transit vulnerable to interception or man-in-the-middle attacks. To address this, the attribute should be set to `https-only` in all cache behaviors (e.g., `viewer_protocol_policy = \"https-only\"`), ensuring all communications between CloudFront and the end user are encrypted, thus preserving the confidentiality and integrity of the data.",
