  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the `minimum_compression_size` attribute is set to a value greater than -1 and less than 10485760 for the `aws_api_gateway_rest_api` resource, enabling proper payload compression. Without valid configuration, API data transfer can be inefficient, leading to increased bandwidth costs and a slower experience for API consumers. Setting a secure configuration like\n\n```\nresource \"aws_api_gateway_rest_api\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"regional-example\"\n\n  endpoint_configuration {\n    types = [\"REGIONAL\"]\n  }\n\n  minimum_compression_size = 0\n}\n```\n\nensures that response payloads are compressed appropriately, improving performance and security by preventing the misuse or neglect of compression settings.",
