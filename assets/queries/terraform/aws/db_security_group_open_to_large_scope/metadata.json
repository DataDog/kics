  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that DB security groups aren't configured with overly broad CIDR ranges that could expose your database to unnecessary network access. When a CIDR block with more than 256 hosts (such as /24 or lower) is configured in the ingress rules, it increases the attack surface and potential for unauthorized access to your database instances.\n\nIn the insecure example below, the security group allows access from a /24 CIDR block (256 hosts):\n```\nresource \"aws_db_security_group\" \"positive1\" {\n  name = \"rds_sg\"\n\n  ingress {\n    cidr = \"10.0.0.0/24\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo remediate this issue, restrict access to a smaller CIDR range with fewer hosts, such as /25 (128 hosts) or more restrictive:\n```\nresource \"aws_db_security_group\" \"negative1\" {\n  name = \"rds_sg\"\n\n  ingress {\n    cidr = \"10.0.0.0/25\"\n  }\n}\n```",
