  "severity": "LOW",
  "category": "Observability",
  "descriptionText": "An API Gateway Deployment should have an associated UsagePlan defined using the `aws_api_gateway_usage_plan` resource, with the `api_stages` attribute referencing the relevant API and stage. Without a UsagePlan, API Gateway endpoints are left unprotected, allowing unlimited, unauthenticated access and risking abuse, denial of service, or unexpected cost overruns. To prevent this, always associate deployments with a UsagePlan as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_api_gateway_usage_plan\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"usage-plan\"\n  api_stages {\n    api_id = aws_api_gateway_deployment.example.rest_api_id\n    stage  = aws_api_gateway_deployment.example.stage_name\n  }\n}\n```",
