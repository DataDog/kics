  "descriptionText": "Enabling deletion protection for an Application Load Balancer (ALB) helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of the ALB resource, which could cause significant downtime or impact application availability. If the `enable_deletion_protection` attribute is set to `false`, as shown below, malicious or inadvertent actions could destroy the ALB and disrupt traffic flow to critical applications:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_alb\" \"example\" {\n  name                      = \"test-lb-tf\"\n  internal                  = false\n  load_balancer_type        = \"network\"\n  subnets                   = aws_subnet.public.*.id\n\n  enable_deletion_protection = true\n\n  tags = {\n    Environment = \"production\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEnabling this setting minimizes the risk of outages by requiring an extra step to delete the load balancer, thereby safeguarding essential network infrastructure.",
