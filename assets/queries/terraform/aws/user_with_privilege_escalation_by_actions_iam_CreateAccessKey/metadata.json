  "descriptionText": "Granting a user the `iam:CreateAccessKey` action with a resource set to `\"*\"` allows that user to create access keys for any IAM user in the AWS account. This over-privileged configuration, as shown below, introduces a privilege escalation risk, as the user could generate access keys for higher-privileged users and gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources:\n\n```\npolicy = jsonencode({\n  Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n  Statement = [\n    {\n      Action = [\n        \"iam:CreateAccessKey\",\n      ]\n      Effect   = \"Allow\"\n      Resource = \"*\"\n    },\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nTo mitigate this risk, limit the action and resource to the specific user needing access, or scope the permissions more narrowly to avoid unauthorized key creation.",
