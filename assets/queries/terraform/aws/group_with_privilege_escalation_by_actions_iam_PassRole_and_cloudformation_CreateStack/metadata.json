  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Allowing an IAM group broad permissions with `\"cloudformation:CreateStack\"` and `\"iam:PassRole\"` actions on all resources (`\"Resource\": \"*\"`) enables privilege escalation. With these permissions, a user can create a CloudFormation stack that provisions new IAM users, roles, or policies with elevated privileges and then use `iam:PassRole` to assume those roles, effectively bypassing intended access controls. If left unaddressed, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive AWS resources or take full control of the account.",
