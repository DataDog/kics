  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Granting an IAM role permission to perform `iam:AttachRolePolicy` with `Resource = \"*\"` allows the role to attach any policy to any role in the AWS environment, including itself. This enables privilege escalation, as a user or process with this permission can grant themselves full administrative privileges or access beyond what was originally intended. If left unaddressed, such a configuration could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or full compromise of the AWS account.",
