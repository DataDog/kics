  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Single Sign-On (SSO) permission sets should restrict user session durations to a maximum of one hour to reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access and session hijacking. Allowing longer session durations by setting the `session_duration` attribute to values such as `\"PT2H\"` or `\"PT1H1M\"` in the `aws_ssoadmin_permission_set` resource increases the risk of attackers leveraging stale or stolen sessions. Configuring session durations to `session_duration = \"PT1H\"`, or omitting the duration in the configuration enforces this security best practice and helps limit potential exposure.\n\n```\nresource \"aws_ssoadmin_permission_set\" \"example\" {\n  name             = \"Example\"\n  instance_arn     = tolist(data.aws_ssoadmin_instances.example.arns)[0]\n  relay_state      = \"https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1//\"\n  session_duration = \"PT1H\"\n}\n```",
