  "queryName": "Role With Privilege Escalation By Actions 'iam:CreatePolicyVersion'",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Granting the `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` action with a resource of `\"*\"` in an IAM policy allows a user to create new policy versions for *any* policy in the AWS account, including those attached to highly privileged roles. This capability can be exploited for privilege escalation, as a malicious or compromised user could attach or update policies to grant themselves broader permissions. To mitigate this risk, restrict the `Resource` attribute to specific policy ARNs and only grant this action to trusted administrative principals.\n\nA more secure configuration would specify only necessary actions for the specific resources required, for example:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_iam_user\" \"cosmic2\" {\n  name = \"cosmic2\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_user_policy\" \"inline_policy_run_instances2\" {\n  name = \"inline_policy_run_instances\"\n  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name\n\n  policy = jsonencode({\n    Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n    Statement = [\n      {\n        Action = [\n          \"ec2:Describe*\",\n        ]\n        Effect   = \"Allow\"\n        Resource = \"*\"\n      },\n    ]\n  })\n}\n```",
