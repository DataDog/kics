  "descriptionText": "AWS resource tagging is an essential best practice that supports resource management, cost tracking, automation, and security enforcement. If only the default `Name` tag is applied and no additional metadata tags (such as `Environment`, `Owner`, or `Project`) are defined, resources may become difficult to identify, audit, and manage at scale, increasing the risk of misconfiguration or unintended resource exposure. For example, a secure configuration should use a `tags` block with descriptive tags:\n\n```\ntags = {\n  Name        = \"example-cert\"\n  Environment = \"production\"\n  Owner       = \"devops-team\"\n}\n```",
