  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "AWS CloudWatch log groups should use KMS encryption to protect sensitive log data at rest. When the `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` resource is defined without the `kms_key_id` attribute, as in the following example, logs are stored unencrypted or with default encryption, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access if AWS accounts or storage is compromised:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_cloudwatch_log_group\" \"negative1\" {\n  name = \"Yada\"\n  retention_in_days = 1\n}\n```\n\nBy specifying the `kms_key_id` attribute, you ensure that log data is encrypted with a customer-managed AWS KMS key, reducing the risk of data exposure.",
