      "descriptionText": "This check verifies that AWS DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator) clusters have server-side encryption enabled to protect data at rest. Without encryption, sensitive data stored in DAX clusters could be exposed if unauthorized access to the storage media occurs, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations.\n\nTo secure a DAX cluster, you must include a 'server_side_encryption' block with 'enabled = true' as shown below:\n```\nresource \"aws_dax_cluster\" \"secure_example\" {\n  cluster_name       = \"cluster-example\"\n  // other configuration...\n  \n  server_side_encryption {\n    enabled = true\n  }\n}\n```\nInsecure configurations either omit the server_side_encryption block entirely, include an empty block, or explicitly set 'enabled = false'."
