  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Observability",
  "descriptionText": "Enabling logging for AWS CloudFront distributions is critical to ensure that all viewer requests are captured for security monitoring, troubleshooting, and compliance. Logging is enabled in Terraform by including the `logging_config` attribute within the `aws_cloudfront_distribution` resource, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_cloudfront_distribution\" \"logging_enabled\" {\n  // ... other configuration ...\n  logging_config {\n    include_cookies = false\n    bucket          = \"mylogs.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n    prefix          = \"myprefix\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWithout logging enabled, malicious or unauthorized access patterns can go undetected, leaving the distribution vulnerable to abuse and limiting forensic analysis capabilities in the event of an incident.",
