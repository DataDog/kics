  "descriptionText": "This check verifies that the AWS root user is required to authenticate using multi-factor authentication (MFA). If the root user is not protected with MFA, as in a policy lacking a condition on `\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\"`, unauthorized users with access to the root credentials could compromise the entire AWS account. Enforcing MFA by adding a policy condition such as\n\n```\n\"Condition\": {\n  \"BoolIfExists\": {\n    \"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": \"true\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nsignificantly reduces the risk of credential theft, unauthorized privilege escalation, and account takeovers.",
