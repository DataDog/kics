  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Granting a user the `iam:PutUserPolicy` action with a Resource value of `\"*\"` allows that user to attach any policy to any IAM user, including themselves. This creates a privilege escalation vulnerability, as the user could grant themselves administrative permissions or access otherwise restricted resources. To mitigate this risk, permission sets should be strictly defined and limited; for example, only allowing non-privileged actions such as:\n\n```\npolicy = jsonencode({\n  Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n  Statement = [\n    {\n      Action = [\n        \"ec2:Describe*\"\n      ]\n      Effect   = \"Allow\"\n      Resource = \"*\"\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\nLimiting permissions in this way reduces the risk of unauthorized privilege escalation.",
