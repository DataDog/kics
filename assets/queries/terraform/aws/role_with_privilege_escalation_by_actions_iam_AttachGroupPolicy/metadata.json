  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Granting the action `iam:AttachGroupPolicy` with the resource set to `*` in an AWS IAM role allows the entity to attach any group policy to any group in the AWS account, providing a path to privilege escalation. An attacker with this permission could leverage it to assign powerful permissions to groups they control or are a member of, thereby elevating their own privileges or those of other malicious accounts. If left unaddressed, this misconfiguration can result in unauthorized access or complete compromise of AWS resources, posing a serious security risk. It is critical to restrict the `iam:AttachGroupPolicy` action to specific, trusted resources and avoid using overly broad permissions in IAM policies.",
