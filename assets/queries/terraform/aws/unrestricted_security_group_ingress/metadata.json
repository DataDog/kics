  "descriptionText": "This check identifies AWS security group rules that allow unrestricted inbound traffic from any IP address (`0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4 or `::/0` for IPv6). Such configurations create a significant security vulnerability by exposing your resources to potential unauthorized access from anywhere on the internet, increasing the risk of data breaches and attacks.\n\nRestricting inbound traffic to specific, trusted IP addresses, or CIDR ranges is a security best practice that follows the principle of least privilege. Instead of using wide-open rules such as `cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]`, configure your security groups with specific CIDR blocks, as shown in the secure example: `cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.2.0/0\"]` or more targeted ranges like corporate IP addresses.",
