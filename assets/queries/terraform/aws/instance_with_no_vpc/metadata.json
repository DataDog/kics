  "descriptionText": "Amazon EC2 instances should always be provisioned within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to leverage the network isolation, traffic filtering, and granular access controls that VPCs provide. If EC2 instances are created without specifying a `subnet_id` or `vpc_security_group_ids` (as shown in the configuration below), they may default to legacy EC2-Classic networks or lack critical network restrictions, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and exposure to attacks. Using a VPC ensures all traffic to and from instances can be centrally managed, monitored, and audited, reducing the attack surface.\n\nInsecure example:\n```\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  ami           = \"ami-003634241a8fcdec0\"\n  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n}\n```\n\nSecure example:\n```\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  ami                    = \"ami-003634241a8fcdec0\"\n  instance_type          = \"t2.micro\"\n  subnet_id              = aws_subnet.example.id\n  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.example.id]\n}\n```",
