      "descriptionText": "AWS Elasticsearch domains should enforce IAM authentication to restrict access to authorized users only. Without proper IAM policies—such as using `\"Principal\": \"*\"` in the `aws_elasticsearch_domain_policy` resource—unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive data by connecting from approved IP addresses. To mitigate this risk, the `Principal` field should be set to reference specific IAM principals, as shown below:\n\n```\n\"Principal\" : {\n  \"AWS\": [\n    \"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root\",\n    \"arn:aws:iam::555555555555:root\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFailing to enforce IAM authentication can expose your Elasticsearch domain to unauthorized access and potential data breaches."
