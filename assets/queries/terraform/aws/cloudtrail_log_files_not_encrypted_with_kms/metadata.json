  "descriptionText": "CloudTrail logs contain sensitive information about account activity and should be protected from unauthorized access. If the `kms_key_id` attribute is not specified in the `aws_cloudtrail` resource block, as shown in:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_cloudtrail\" \"positive1\" {\n  name           = \"npositive_1\"\n  s3_bucket_name = \"bucketlog_1\"\n}\n```\n\nthen the logs stored in S3 are not encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key, leaving them vulnerable to exposure or tampering. Using the `kms_key_id` attribute, as in:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_cloudtrail\" \"negative1\" {\n  name           = \"negative1\"\n  s3_bucket_name = \"bucketlog1\"\n  kms_key_id     = \"arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012\"\n}\n```\n\nensures that the logs are protected with strong encryption, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and helping meet compliance requirements.",
