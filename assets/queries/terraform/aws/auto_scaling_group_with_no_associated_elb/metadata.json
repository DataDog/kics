  "descriptionText": "AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) should have associated Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) to ensure high availability and efficient distribution of incoming traffic. Without specifying the `load_balancers` attribute, for example:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_autoscaling_group\" \"bar\" {\n  ...\n  // missing `load_balancers`\n}\n```\n\ninstances launched by the ASG may become inaccessible or experience uneven traffic distribution, leading to reduced reliability and performance. To remediate this, the `load_balancers` attribute should be defined as in the secure example below:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_autoscaling_group\" \"bar3\" {\n  ...\n  load_balancers = [\"elb_1\"]\n}\n```",
