      "descriptionText": "This check identifies when CloudTrail logs are being stored in an S3 bucket that is publicly accessible, which creates a significant security risk. CloudTrail logs contain sensitive information about API calls and activities in your AWS environment that could be exposed to unauthorized parties if stored in a public bucket. To remediate this issue, ensure your S3 bucket has its ACL set to private instead of public-read as shown in the example below:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"b\" {\n  bucket = \"my-tf-test-bucket\"\n  acl    = \"private\"  // Correct setting instead of \"public-read\"\n}\n```"
    }
