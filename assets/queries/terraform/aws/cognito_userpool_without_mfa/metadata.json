  "descriptionText": "AWS Cognito user pools should have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled to enhance the security of user accounts. If the `mfa_configuration` attribute is set to `\"OFF\"` or left undefined, as in the following example, users are only required to use a single authentication factor, making their accounts more susceptible to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.\n\n```\nresource \"aws_cognito_user_pool\" \"example\" {\n  mfa_configuration = \"OFF\"\n  // ... other configuration ...\n}\n```\n\nEnabling MFA (for example, `mfa_configuration = \"ON\"` or `\"OPTIONAL\"`) significantly reduces the risk of account takeover by requiring an additional authentication factor.",
