  "descriptionText": "Enabling stack notifications in AWS CloudFormation ensures that administrators are promptly informed about critical events such as stack creation, updates, or failures. Without specifying the `notification_arns` attribute in the Terraform resource, as shown below, important operational or security changes may go unnoticed, potentially delaying response to incidents or failures:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_cloudformation_stack\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"networking-stack\"\n  parameters = {\n    VPCCidr = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n  }\n  notification_arns = [\"arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic\"]\n}\n```\n\nMissing notifications can lead to undetected application outages or misconfigurations, increasing the risk to your cloud infrastructure.",
