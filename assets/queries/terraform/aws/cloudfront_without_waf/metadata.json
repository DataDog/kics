  "descriptionText": "AWS CloudFront distributions should be integrated with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) by specifying the `web_acl_id` attribute. If a CloudFront distribution is created without a WAF association (`web_acl_id` missing), the application is left vulnerable to common web attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Failing to link a WAF to your CloudFront distribution increases the risk of security breaches, potential data loss, and service interruption.",
