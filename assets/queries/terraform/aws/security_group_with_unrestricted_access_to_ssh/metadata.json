  "queryName": "Security group with unrestricted access to SSH",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "This check verifies that AWS security groups do not allow unrestricted inbound access to port 22 (SSH) from the public internet (`cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]`). Allowing public SSH access exposes instances to unauthorized access attempts and automated attacks, increasing the risk of successful brute-force compromises. To mitigate this vulnerability, the `cidr_blocks` attribute in the `ingress` block should be restricted to trusted IP ranges only, as shown below:\n\nInsecure configuration:\n```\ningress {\n  from_port   = 22\n  to_port     = 22\n  protocol    = \"tcp\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n}\n```\n\nSecure configuration:\n```\ningress {\n  from_port   = 22\n  to_port     = 22\n  protocol    = \"tcp\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"192.120.0.0/16\", \"75.132.0.0/16\"]\n}\n```\nIf left unaddressed, this misconfiguration can lead to remote attackers gaining entry to instances via SSH, putting sensitive data and critical infrastructure at risk.",
