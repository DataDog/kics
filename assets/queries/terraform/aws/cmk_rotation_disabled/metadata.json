  "descriptionText": "Customer Master Keys (CMKs) created using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) should have automatic key rotation enabled to enhance cryptographic security. Failing to set the `enable_key_rotation` attribute to `true` may increase the risk of key compromise, as cryptographic keys used over extended periods are more susceptible to brute-force or other attacks. Enabling rotation ensures the key material is automatically replaced annually, reducing exposure and supporting compliance with security best practices.\n\n```\nresource \"aws_kms_key\" \"example\" {\n  description         = \"KMS key with rotation enabled\"\n  is_enabled          = true\n  enable_key_rotation = true\n}\n```",
