  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Best Practices",
  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the AWS IAM password policy enforces the use of at least one lowercase letter in user passwords by setting `require_lowercase_characters = true` in the `aws_iam_account_password_policy` resource. If this setting is left as `require_lowercase_characters = false`, passwords are less complex and easier for attackers to guess or brute-force, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to AWS resources. Weak password policies can significantly undermine the security posture of your AWS environment.",
