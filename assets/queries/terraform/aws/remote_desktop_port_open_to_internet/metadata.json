      "descriptionText": "This check identifies AWS Security Groups that have Remote Desktop ports (commonly in ranges 3380-3450) exposed to the internet via '0.0.0.0/0' or similar CIDR blocks. Exposing Remote Desktop ports to the public internet creates a significant security risk as it allows potential attackers to attempt brute force attacks against your instances. Instead, restrict access to specific trusted IP ranges or use a bastion host/VPN for secure remote access.\n\nSecure example:\n```terraform\ningress {\n  description = \"Remote desktop open private\"\n  from_port   = 3380\n  to_port     = 3450\n  protocol    = \"tcp\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"10.0.0.0/16\"]  # Restricted to private network\n}\n```\n\nInsecure example:\n```terraform\ningress {\n  description = \"Remote desktop port open\"\n  from_port   = 3380\n  to_port     = 3450\n  protocol    = \"tcp\"\n  cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]  # Open to the internet\n}\n```"
