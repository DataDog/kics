  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Observability",
  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that a CloudWatch log metric filter and corresponding alarm are properly configured to monitor AWS Management Console authentication failures. Without a correct association between the metric alarm (`aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.metric_name`) and the log metric filter (for example, `aws_cloudwatch_metric_filter.cis_console_authn_failure_metric_filter.id`), failed login events may go undetected, leaving the environment vulnerable to brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts. A secure Terraform configuration links the alarm to the appropriate metric filter, as shown below:\n\n```\nmetric_name = aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter.cis_console_authn_failure_metric_filter.id\n```\n\nThis enables timely alerting on suspicious authentication failures, reducing the risk of compromised credentials going unnoticed.",
