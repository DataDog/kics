  "descriptionText": "This check identifies IAM policies that permit the action `iam:AttachUserPolicy` with the `Resource` field set to `\"*\"`. Granting this permission to a user, as shown below, allows them to attach any AWS managed or custom policy to any user, which can lead to privilege escalation and potential compromise of the AWS environment.\n\n```\npolicy = jsonencode({\n  Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n  Statement = [\n    {\n      Action = [\n        \"iam:AttachUserPolicy\",\n      ]\n      Effect   = \"Allow\"\n      Resource = \"*\"\n    },\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nIf left unaddressed, an attacker with this permission could escalate their privileges far beyond what was originally intended, potentially gaining administrative access and leading to a full environment takeover.",
