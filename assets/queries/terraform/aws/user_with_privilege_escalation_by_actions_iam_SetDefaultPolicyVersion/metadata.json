  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Granting the `iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion` action with a resource of `\"*\"` allows a user to set any version of any IAM policy as the default, including attaching more permissive versions to roles or users. This creates a serious privilege escalation risk, as an attacker with these permissions could assign themselves or others elevated privileges by setting a policy version that permits broader or unauthorized access. If left unaddressed, this vulnerability could lead to full account compromise or unapproved actions throughout the AWS environment.",
