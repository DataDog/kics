  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "When an S3 bucket policy allows all actions ('s3:*') to all principals ('*'), it creates a severe security vulnerability by exposing your data to unauthorized access, modification, and deletion by anyone on the internet. Instead of using overly permissive policies like 's3:*', implement the principle of least privilege by granting only specific permissions (e.g., 's3:putObject') that are required for legitimate operations. For example, replace insecure configurations like 'Action': ['s3:*'] with more restrictive ones such as 'Action': ['s3:putObject'] to ensure your S3 buckets remain protected while still enabling necessary functionality.",
