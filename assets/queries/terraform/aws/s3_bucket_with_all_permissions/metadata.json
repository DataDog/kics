  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "When an S3 bucket policy allows all actions (`s3:*`) to all principals (`*`), it creates a severe security vulnerability by exposing your data to unauthorized access, modification, and deletion by anyone on the internet. Instead of using overly permissive policies like `s3:*`, implement the principle of least privilege by granting only specific permissions (for example, `s3:putObject`) that are required for legitimate operations. For example, replace insecure configurations like `Action`: [`s3:*`] with more restrictive ones such as `Action`: [`s3:putObject`] to ensure your S3 buckets remain protected while still enabling necessary functionality.",
