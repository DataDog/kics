  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "This vulnerability occurs when an S3 bucket policy allows the delete action from all principals (*), which can lead to unauthorized deletion of data and potential data loss or service disruption. Even when IP address conditions are applied, allowing delete actions from all principals presents a significant security risk as it could be exploited if the IP restriction is bypassed or misconfigured.\n\nThe insecure configuration looks like:\n```\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"Principal\": \"*\",\n  \"Action\": \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::my_tf_test_bucket/*\"\n}\n```\n\nTo secure your S3 bucket, either explicitly deny the action or restrict it to specific principals:\n```\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n  \"Action\": \"s3:*\",\n  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::my_tf_test_bucket/*\"\n}\n```",
