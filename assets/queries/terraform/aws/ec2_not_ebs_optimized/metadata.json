  "descriptionText": "Ensuring that an EC2 instance uses EBS optimization is important for maximizing the performance of attached EBS volumes, as this setting reduces contention between EBS I/O and other instance traffic. If the `ebs_optimized` attribute is not enabled, disk operations may experience degraded performance, leading to slower application response times and potential reliability issues under load. To remediate this, set `ebs_optimized = true` in your instance configuration, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"web\" {\n  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id\n  instance_type = \"t3.micro\"\n  ebs_optimized = true\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"HelloWorld\"\n  }\n}\n```",
