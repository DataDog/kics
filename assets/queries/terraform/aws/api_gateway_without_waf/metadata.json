  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that AWS API Gateway stages are protected by an associated Web Application Firewall (WAF) using the `aws_wafregional_web_acl_association` resource. Without a WAF enabled, exposed API endpoints are left unprotected against common web threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other HTTP-based attacks, increasing the risk of data breaches or service disruption. To secure your API Gateway, associate a WAF Web ACL to your stage, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_wafregional_web_acl_association\" \"association\" {\n  resource_arn = aws_api_gateway_stage.negative1.arn\n  web_acl_id   = aws_wafregional_web_acl.foo.id\n}\n```",
