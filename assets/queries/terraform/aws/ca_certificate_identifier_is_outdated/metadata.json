  "descriptionText": "AWS RDS instances require the use of a trusted and up-to-date Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for encrypted connections. If the `ca_cert_identifier` attribute is set to an outdated value like `\"rds-ca-2015\"` instead of the recommended `\"rds-ca-2019\"`, as shown below:\n\n```\nca_cert_identifier = \"rds-ca-2015\"\n```\n\nthe database may be vulnerable to deprecation-related outages or security issues due to expired or compromised certificates. Using the correct CA certificate ensures continued support, compliance, and secure encrypted communications with the database.",
