  "descriptionText": "It is a best practice for AWS security groups to include a meaningful `description` attribute in their Terraform configuration, such as in the following example:\n\n```\ndescription = \"Allow TLS inbound traffic\"\n```\n\nOmitting the description field, as shown below, can lead to confusion and hinder effective management or auditing of security groups, especially in environments with many resources:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"allow_tls\" {\n  name   = \"allow_tls\"\n  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id\n  // missing description\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nWithout clear descriptions, security teams may struggle to quickly identify the purpose of a group, increasing the risk of misconfigurations and delayed incident response.",
