  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "Default Security Groups are automatically created when a VPC is created and allow all inbound traffic from resources assigned to the same security group and all outbound traffic by default when explicitly configured with open rules. This creates a significant security vulnerability as it allows unrestricted network access between resources, potentially enabling lateral movement during a breach. \n\nSecure implementation should not define open ingress/egress rules, as in the following example:\n```\nresource \"aws_default_security_group\" \"default2\" {\n  vpc_id = aws_vpc.mainvpc2.id\n}\n```\n\nAvoid explicitly configuring rules that allow all traffic, such as:\n```\ningress = [{\n  protocol  = -1\n  self      = true\n  from_port = 0\n  to_port   = 0\n}]\n```",
