  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Allowing a user the `iam:UpdateLoginProfile` permission with the `Resource` set to `\"*\"` in Terraform, as in:\n\n```\nAction = [\n  \"iam:UpdateLoginProfile\",\n]\nResource = \"*\"\n```\n\nenables that user to change the passwords of any IAM user in the AWS account. This creates a privilege escalation risk, as the user could assign themselves or others passwords to high-privilege accounts, resulting in unauthorized access or control over critical resources. If left unaddressed, this misconfiguration can lead to account compromise and the potential for significant security incidents.",
