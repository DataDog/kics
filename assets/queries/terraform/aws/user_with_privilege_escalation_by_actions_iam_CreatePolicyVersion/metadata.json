  "descriptionText": "Allowing a user the `iam:CreatePolicyVersion` action with the resource set to `\"*\"` in Terraform, as shown in the policy statement below, enables them to update any IAM policy in the AWS account. This privilege can be exploited for privilege escalation, as the user could create a new policy version attaching elevated permissions to themselves or others.\n\n```\npolicy = jsonencode({\n  Version = \"2012-10-17\"\n  Statement = [\n    {\n      Action = [\n        \"iam:CreatePolicyVersion\",\n      ]\n      Effect   = \"Allow\"\n      Resource = \"*\"\n    },\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nIf left unaddressed, this misconfiguration could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized administrative access or perform malicious actions across your AWS environment by changing permissions on any IAM policy.",
