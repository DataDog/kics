  "descriptionText": "This check verifies that Amazon SNS topic policies do not allow public access by having wildcard principals in their IAM policies. When an SNS topic policy includes a principal with wildcard (`*`) or allows anonymous access, it makes the topic publicly accessible to any AWS account, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized message publishing/consumption.\n\nSecure configuration requires specifying explicit IAM principals rather than using wildcards. For example, instead of using `\"AWS\": \"*\"` which grants access to anyone, use a specific account ARN like `\"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::account_number:root\"` to limit access to authorized entities only. This prevents unauthorized access to your SNS topics and their messages.",
