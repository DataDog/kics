  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that AWS CodeBuild projects are encrypted using customer-managed KMS keys rather than the default AWS-managed keys. Using the default AWS-managed key (e.g., `encryption_key = data.aws_kms_key.by_alias.arn` where `key_id = \"alias/aws/s3\"`) provides less control over key rotation, access policies, and audit logging, potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized data access. To maximize security and compliance, the `encryption_key` attribute should reference a customer-managed KMS key (such as `key_id = \"alias/myAlias\"`), allowing organizations to fully manage encryption controls for sensitive CodeBuild project data.",
