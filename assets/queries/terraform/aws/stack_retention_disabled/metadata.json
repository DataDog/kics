  "severity": "MEDIUM",

  "descriptionText": "When defining an `aws_cloudformation_stack_set_instance` resource in Terraform, it is important to set the `retain_stack` attribute to `true`. If `retain_stack` is set to `false` or omitted (the default value is `false`), the underlying CloudFormation stack and all associated resources will be deleted when the stack set instance is destroyed or removed from the configuration. This creates a risk of accidental and irreversible data loss, as resources could be unintentionally deleted during operations such as stack set updates, deletions, or when Terraform destroy is executed. Ensuring that `retain_stack` is enabled (`retain_stack = true`) helps protect critical infrastructure by leaving the stack and its resources intact even after the stack set instance is removed, allowing for manual intervention or recovery if needed.",
