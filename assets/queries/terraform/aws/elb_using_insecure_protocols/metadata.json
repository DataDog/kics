  "descriptionText": "Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) security policies should not enable insecure protocols such as SSLv3, TLSv1, or TLSv1.1, as these older protocols are vulnerable to well-known exploits that can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between clients and the load balancer. In Terraform, this means avoiding policy attributes like `name = \"Protocol-SSLv3\"` or `name = \"Protocol-TLSv1\"` with a value of `\"true\"`. A secure configuration should explicitly allow only newer protocols such as TLSv1.2, for example:\n\n```\npolicy_attribute {\n  name  = \"Protocol-TLSv1.2\"\n  value = \"true\"\n}\n```\n\nLeaving insecure protocols enabled increases the risk of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and data breaches for all applications using the ELB.",
