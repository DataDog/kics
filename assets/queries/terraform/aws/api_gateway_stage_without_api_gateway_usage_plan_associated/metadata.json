  "queryName": "API Gateway Stage Without API Gateway UsagePlan Associated",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "category": "Resource Management",
  "descriptionText": "API Gateway stages should always be associated with an API Gateway UsagePlan, which enforces throttling and quota limits for clients accessing your APIs. Without a defined `aws_api_gateway_usage_plan` resource and its association via the `api_stages` block, as shown below,\n\n```\nresource \"aws_api_gateway_stage\" \"example\" {\n  deployment_id = \"some deployment id\"\n  rest_api_id   = \"some rest api id\"\n  stage_name    = \"development\"\n}\n```\n\nthe API stage can be accessed without usage restrictions, leading to potential misuse, abuse, or denial of service due to unlimited traffic. Configuring a UsagePlan like\n\n```\nresource \"aws_api_gateway_usage_plan\" \"example\" {\n  name        = \"my-usage-plan\"\n  description = \"usage plan description\"\n  api_stages {\n    api_id = \"some rest api id\"\n    stage  = \"development\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nhelps mitigate these risks by controlling consumption through quotas and throttling, protecting backend resources and maintaining predictable API performance.",
