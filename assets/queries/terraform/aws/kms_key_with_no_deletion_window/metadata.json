  "severity": "LOW",
  "category": "Observability",
  "descriptionText": "When creating an AWS KMS key using Terraform, the `deletion_window_in_days` attribute specifies the waiting period before a key is permanently deleted after a deletion request. If this attribute is not set or is configured with an excessively high value, such as `deletion_window_in_days = 31`, it can delay key deletion and increase exposure to accidental or malicious use if a compromised key remains active for longer than necessary. Setting a minimal but valid window, such as `deletion_window_in_days = 10`, reduces this risk by ensuring that keys are deleted more promptly after they are scheduled for removal.\n\n```\nresource \"aws_kms_key\" \"negative1\" {\n  description             = \"KMS key 1\"\n\n  is_enabled = true\n\n  enable_key_rotation = true\n\n  deletion_window_in_days = 10\n}\n```",
