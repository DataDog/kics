  "descriptionText": "Google Compute Engine instances should not be configured to use the default service account, which has broad permissions and full access to all Cloud APIs. If the attribute `service_account`—specifically the `email` sub-attribute—is missing, empty, or set to the default Google Compute Engine service account, it increases the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive resources. Instead, instances should explicitly specify a custom service account with only the necessary permissions, such as in the following example:\n\n```\nservice_account {\n  email  = \"custom-sa@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com\"\n  scopes = [\"userinfo-email\", \"compute-ro\", \"storage-ro\"]\n}\n```",

Additionally, 'email' must not be empty and must also not be a default Google Compute Engine service account."
