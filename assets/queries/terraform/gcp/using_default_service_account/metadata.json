  "descriptionText": "Google Compute Engine instances should not be configured to use the default service account, which has broad permissions and full access to all Cloud APIs. If the attribute `service_account`\u2014specifically the `email` sub-attribute\u2014is missing, empty, or set to the default Google Compute Engine service account, it increases the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive resources. Instead, instances should explicitly specify a custom service account with only the necessary permissions, such as in the following example:\n\n```\nservice_account {\n  email  = \"custom-sa@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com\"\n  scopes = [\"userinfo-email\", \"compute-ro\", \"storage-ro\"]\n}\n```",
