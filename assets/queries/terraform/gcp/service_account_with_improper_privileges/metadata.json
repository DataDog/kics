  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Resource Management",
  "descriptionText": "Granting a service account excessive privileges such as `roles/admin`, `roles/editor`, `roles/owner`, or other write-level roles, can expose the environment to the risk of privilege escalation or unintended changes.  In Terraform, this misconfiguration appears when a binding like the following is used:\n\n```\nbinding {\n  role = \"roles/editor\"\n  members = [\n    \"serviceAccount:jane@example.com\",\n  ]\n}\n```\n\naThis allows the service account broad permissions across resources. To follow the principle of least privilege, grant only the specific roles required. For example:\n\n```\nbinding {\n  role = \"roles/apigee.runtimeAgent\"\n  members = [\n    \"user:jane@example.com\",\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFailing to restrict service account privileges can enable attackers or compromised services to make unauthorized changes, potentially leading to data exposure or resource compromise.",
