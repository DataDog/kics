  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "Allowing a Google Compute Network firewall rule to permit traffic on all TCP ports (using `ports = [\"0-65535\"]`) exposes instances to a broad range of attacks and unauthorized access, increasing the risk of exploitation across unused and potentially vulnerable services. By not restricting allowed ports to only those necessary—such as `ports = [\"80\", \"8080\"]` for web services—the configuration creates a large attack surface. To minimize security risks, firewall rules should define only the specific protocols and ports required for service functionality.",
