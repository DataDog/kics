  "category": "Secret Management",
  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that Google Compute Engine VM instances have project-wide SSH keys blocked by setting the metadata attribute `block-project-ssh-keys` to `\"TRUE\"`. Without this setting, anyone with project-level SSH key access can connect to the VM, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and making it harder to manage individual SSH permissions. For a secure configuration, define the attribute in your Terraform as follows:\n\n```\nmetadata = {\n  block-project-ssh-keys = \"TRUE\"\n}\n```",
