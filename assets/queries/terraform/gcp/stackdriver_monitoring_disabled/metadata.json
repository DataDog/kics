  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Observability",
  "descriptionText": "Kubernetes Engine Clusters must have Stackdriver Monitoring enabled by setting the `monitoring_service` attribute to `\"monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes\"` or leaving it undefined, which allows Google Cloudâ€™s default monitoring. Disabling monitoring by setting `monitoring_service = \"none\"` leaves clusters without visibility into performance, health, or security events, increasing the risk of undetected failures or malicious activity. \n\nSecure configuration should look like:\n\n```\nresource \"google_container_cluster\" \"example\" {\n  name               = \"secure-cluster\"\n  location           = \"us-central1-a\"\n  initial_node_count = 3\n  monitoring_service = \"monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes\"\n}\n```\nIf left unaddressed, this misconfiguration can prevent prompt detection and remediation of operational or security incidents, potentially leading to service outages or breaches.",
