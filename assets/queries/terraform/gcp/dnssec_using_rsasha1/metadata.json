  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "DNSSEC should not use the RSASHA1 algorithm, which is considered weak and vulnerable to cryptographic attacks. If a `dnssec_config` block contains a `default_key_specs` attribute with `algorithm = \"rsasha1\"`, attackers may be able to exploit known weaknesses in the algorithm to forge DNS records, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites or causing other security issues. Instead, use a stronger algorithm such as `rsasha256`:\n\n```\ndnssec_config {\n    default_key_specs {\n        algorithm = \"rsasha256\"\n    }\n}\n```",
