  "descriptionText": "Kubernetes nodes should have automatic upgrades enabled to ensure that critical security patches, bug fixes, and feature updates are applied without manual intervention. In Terraform, this is configured with the `auto_upgrade` attribute inside the `management` block set to `true`:\n\n```\nmanagement {\n  auto_upgrade = true\n}\n```\n\nIf `auto_upgrade` is not enabled, as in the following example, nodes may remain outdated and vulnerable to known security flaws:\n\n```\nmanagement {\n  auto_upgrade = false\n}\n```\n\nLeaving auto upgrade disabled can expose your cluster to exploits and instability due to unpatched vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure.",
