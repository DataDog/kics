  "descriptionText": "Google Cloud Pub/Sub Topics should not be configured to allow public access by assigning IAM roles to the special IAM principals `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers`. Granting roles to these principals, as in the example below,\n\n```\nresource \"google_pubsub_topic_iam_member\" \"bad_example\" {\n  topic  = \"example-topic\"\n  member = \"allUsers\"\n  role   = \"roles/pubsub.publisher\"\n}\n```\n\nmakes the topic accessible to anyone on the internet or to any authenticated Google user, exposing your data to unauthorized access or misuse. To prevent this, restrict the `member` attribute to specific users or service accounts, for example:\n\n```\nresource \"google_pubsub_topic_iam_member\" \"good_example\" {\n  topic  = \"example-topic\"\n  member = \"user:someone@example.com\"\n  role   = \"roles/pubsub.publisher\"\n}\n```",
