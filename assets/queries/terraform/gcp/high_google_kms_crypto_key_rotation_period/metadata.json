  "descriptionText": "It is important to configure Key Management Service (KMS) encryption keys with a `rotation_period` of 90 days or less to limit the blast radius if a key is ever compromised. Failure to set a short rotation period, or omitting the `rotation_period` attribute entirely, increases risk by allowing the same encryption key to remain in use for extended periods, making it a more valuable and longer-lived target if leaked or compromised. Properly securing this setting in Terraform involves specifying the `rotation_period` attribute within the `google_kms_crypto_key` resource, for example:\n\n```\nresource \"google_kms_crypto_key\" \"secure_example\" {\n  name            = \"crypto-key-example\"\n  key_ring        = google_kms_key_ring.keyring.id\n  rotation_period = \"7776000s\" // 90 days\n  lifecycle {\n    prevent_destroy = true\n  }\n}\n```",
