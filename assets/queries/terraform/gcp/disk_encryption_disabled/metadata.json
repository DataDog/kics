  "descriptionText": "Critical virtual machine disks in Google Cloud should be encrypted with Customer Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) or Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) to ensure the security of sensitive data at rest. If the `disk_encryption_key` block is missing or does not include either the `raw_key` or `kms_key_self_link` attributes, disks remain encrypted only with Google-managed keys. This may not meet data residency or compliance requirements and could expose data if the default encryption keys are compromised. To address this, you should define the `disk_encryption_key` with either a CSEK or CMEK, for example:\n\n```\nresource \"google_compute_disk\" \"secure_example\" {\n  name  = \"secure-disk\"\n  type  = \"pd-ssd\"\n  zone  = \"us-central1-a\"\n  image = \"debian-9-stretch-v20200805\"\n  labels = {\n    environment = \"prod\"\n  }\n  physical_block_size_bytes = 4096\n\n  disk_encryption_key {\n    raw_key = \"SGVsbG8gZnJvbSBHb29nbGUgQ2xvdWQgUGxhdGZvcm0=\" // CSEK\n    sha256  = \"A\"\n  }\n}\n```\nUnencrypted disks can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or regulatory compliance violations if left unaddressed.",
