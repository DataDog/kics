  "descriptionText": "A Google Cloud SQL instance becomes publicly accessible when it has public IP addressing enabled without proper network restrictions, creating a potential attack vector for unauthorized access. This can occur through ipv4_enabled being set to true (default) or by configuring authorized_networks with overly permissive CIDR ranges like `0.0.0.0/0` which allows connections from any IP address. To secure Cloud SQL instances, either disable public IP by setting ipv4_enabled to false and specifying a private_network (for example, `ipv4_enabled = false` and `private_network = \"your-network-id\"`) or restrict authorized_networks to specific trusted IP ranges (for example, `authorized_networks { name = \"trusted-network\", value = \"10.0.0.0/24\" }`) rather than using `0.0.0.0/0`.",
