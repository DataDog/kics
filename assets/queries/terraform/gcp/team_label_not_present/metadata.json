  "queryName": "Team Label Missing",
  "severity": "INFO",
  "category": "Best Practices",
  "descriptionText": "To ensure accountability and efficient resource management, every cloud resource should include a `team` label identifying ownership. Without this label, as shown in the example below, resources may lack clear ownership, making it difficult to track responsibility for maintenance, cost allocation, or incident response:\n\n```\nresource \"google_bigtable_instance\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"my-instance\"\n}\n```\n\nProperly labeling resources with a `team` tag, as in the following example, improves governance and accountability:\n\n```\nlabels = {\n  team = \"DevOps\"\n}\n```\n\nNeglecting this can lead to orphaned resources, wasted spend, and slower incident resolution due to unclear points of contact.",
