  "descriptionText": "GKE cluster nodes should be launched with Shielded VM enabled by setting the `enable_shielded_nodes` attribute to `true` in the `google_container_cluster` resource. Failing to enable Shielded VM features exposes cluster nodes to potential rootkit and boot-level malware attacks, as these features help ensure node integrity through secure boot and trusted platform module (TPM) protections. For secure configuration, use:\n\n```\nresource \"google_container_cluster\" \"secure\" {\n  name                  = \"my-gke-cluster\"\n  location              = \"us-central1\"\n  enable_shielded_nodes = true\n}\n```",
