      "descriptionText": "A defective audit logging configuration in Terraform, as defined by the `google_project_iam_audit_config` resource, can lead to incomplete or incorrect logging of critical activities within your cloud environment. For example, omitting required `log_type` values or specifying exempted members, as shown below, allows certain user actions to go unrecorded, potentially bypassing audit trails and hampering incident investigations:\n\n```\nresource \"google_project_iam_audit_config\" \"example\" {\n  project = \"your-project-id\"\n  service = \"allServices\"\n  audit_log_config {\n    log_type = \"DATA_READ\"\n    exempted_members = [\"user:joebloggs@hashicorp.com\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWithout comprehensive audit logs, organizations may be unable to detect or investigate unauthorized access or changes, increasing the risk of undetected misuse or data breaches. A secure configuration should ensure that all required log types (such as `ADMIN_READ` and `DATA_READ`) are enabled and that no users or accounts are unnecessarily exempted from logging."
