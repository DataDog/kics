Enabling serial ports by setting the `serial-port-enable` metadata attribute to `true` (as shown below) can allow anyone with the username, project ID, SSH key, instance name, and zone to directly access the VM, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential compromise.\n\n```\nmetadata = {\n  serial-port-enable = true\n}\n```\n\nTo mitigate this risk, set `serial-port-enable` to `false` to ensure that serial port access is disabled and remote attackers cannot exploit this vector:\n\n```\nmetadata = {\n  serial-port-enable = false\n}\n```",
