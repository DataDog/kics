  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "Allowing ingress from `0.0.0.0/0` on port 21 (FTP) in a firewall rule (`source_ranges = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]`) exposes the FTP service to the entire internet, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access and brute-force attacks. FTP traffic is often unencrypted, which could enable attackers to intercept credentials or exfiltrate sensitive data if unrestricted access is permitted. Restricting ingress to trusted IP ranges (e.g., `source_ranges = [\"192.168.1.0/24\"]`) reduces the attack surface and helps maintain data security.",
