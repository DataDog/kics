  "descriptionText": "Cloud Storage Buckets must not be anonymously or publicly accessible, which means the attribute 'members' must not possess 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'",
  "detailedDescriptionText": "Cloud Storage Buckets configured with anonymous or public access create significant security risks by allowing anyone on the internet to access potentially sensitive data. When 'allUsers' is included in IAM bindings, it grants access to anyone, while 'allAuthenticatedUsers' grants access to anyone with a Google account, both creating overly permissive access controls that violate the principle of least privilege.\n\nInsecure configuration example:\n```\nresource \"google_storage_bucket_iam_binding\" \"insecure\" {\n  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name\n  role = \"roles/storage.admin\"\n  members = [\"user:jane@example.com\", \"allUsers\"]\n}\n```\n\nSecure configuration example:\n```\nresource \"google_storage_bucket_iam_binding\" \"secure\" {\n  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name\n  role = \"roles/storage.admin\"\n  members = [\"user:jane@example.com\"]\n}\n```",
