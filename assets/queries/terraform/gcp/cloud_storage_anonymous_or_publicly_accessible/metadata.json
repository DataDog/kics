  "descriptionText": "Cloud Storage Buckets configured with anonymous or public access pose significant security risks by allowing anyone on the internet to access potentially sensitive data. Including `allUsers` in IAM bindings grants access to anyone, while `allAuthenticatedUsers` grants access to any Google account holder. Both violate the principle of least privilege.\n\nInsecure configuration example:\n```\nresource \"google_storage_bucket_iam_binding\" \"insecure\" {\n  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name\n  role = \"roles/storage.admin\"\n  members = [\"user:jane@example.com\", \"allUsers\"]\n}\n```\n\nSecure configuration example:\n```\nresource \"google_storage_bucket_iam_binding\" \"secure\" {\n  bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name\n  role = \"roles/storage.admin\"\n  members = [\"user:jane@example.com\"]\n}\n```",
