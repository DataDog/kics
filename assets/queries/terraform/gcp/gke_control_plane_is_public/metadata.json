  "descriptionText": "Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control plane is the management layer that controls the Kubernetes cluster. When the control plane is publicly accessible, it increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access to your cluster's management functionality. Exposing the control plane to the public internet (using '0.0.0.0/0' CIDR block) allows potential attackers to attempt brute force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the API server.\n\nTo secure your GKE cluster, restrict access to the control plane by specifying known private IP ranges in the master_authorized_networks_config block. For example, instead of using a public CIDR block like `cidr_block = \"0.0.0.0/0\"`, use a private network range such as `cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/8\"` to limit access to your internal networks only.",
