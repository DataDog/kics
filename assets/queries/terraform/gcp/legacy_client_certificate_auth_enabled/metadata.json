  "descriptionText": "Kubernetes clusters in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) should use the default OAuth authentication, ensuring that client certificates are not issued for cluster authentication. This is enforced in Terraform by setting `master_auth.client_certificate_config.issue_client_certificate` to `false` or by omitting the attribute entirely. Allowing client certificate issuance (`issue_client_certificate = true`) increases the clusterâ€™s attack surface by enabling users to authenticate with potentially compromised or unmanaged certificates, potentially leading to unauthorized access.\n\nFor a secure configuration, ensure the relevant block in Terraform looks like:\n\n```\nmaster_auth {\n  client_certificate_config {\n    issue_client_certificate = false\n  }\n}\n```\nor is simply omitted.",
