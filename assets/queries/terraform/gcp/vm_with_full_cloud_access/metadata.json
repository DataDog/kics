  "descriptionText": "Configuring a Google Compute Engine VM instance to use the default service account with the `cloud-platform` scope (full access to all Cloud APIs) allows any process on that instance to interact with all enabled Google Cloud services in the project. This significantly increases the risk of privilege escalation or unintended data exposure. For example, the following configuration is insecure:\n\n```\nservice_account {\n  scopes = [\"userinfo-email\", \"compute-ro\", \"storage-ro\", \"cloud-platform\"] // 'cloud-platform' grants full access to all Cloud APIs\n}\n```\n\nTo reduce risk, grant the service account only the minimal set of scopes necessary:\n\n```\nservice_account {\n  scopes = [\"userinfo-email\", \"compute-ro\", \"storage-ro\"]\n}\n```\n\nExcessive permissions can allow attackers or compromised applications to gain broad, unnecessary access across your cloud environment.",
