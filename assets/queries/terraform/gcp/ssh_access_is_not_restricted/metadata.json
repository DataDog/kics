  "descriptionText": "Allowing SSH access (TCP port 22) from the Internet (such as setting `source_ranges = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]` in a `google_compute_firewall` resource) exposes virtual machine instances to potential unauthorized access and brute-force attacks, violating the principle of least privilege. Attackers scanning public IP ranges can exploit this misconfiguration to gain direct access to your systems, increasing the risk of compromise. A secure configuration should restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses or private networks, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"google_compute_firewall\" \"secure_example\" {\n  name    = \"restricted-ssh\"\n  network = google_compute_network.default.name\n\n  allow {\n    protocol = \"tcp\"\n    ports    = [\"22\"]\n  }\n  source_ranges = [\"203.0.113.0/24\"] // Replace with trusted IP range\n  source_tags = [\"admin\"]\n}\n```",
