  "descriptionText": "Assigning an IAM role directly to a user rather than to a group is considered a misconfiguration, as it reduces flexibility and scalability in managing permissions. This practice can also lead to security risks; if the user leaves the organization or changes roles, their individual permissions may be overlooked and not revoked, resulting in excessive access. Using a group-based assignment, as shown below, ensures a more centralized and manageable permission structure:\n\n```\ndata \"google_iam_policy\" \"secure\" {\n  binding {\n    role = \"roles/apigee.runtimeAgent\"\n\n    members = [\n      \"group:jane@example.com\",\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
