  "descriptionText": "This check verifies that Google Project IAM Member service accounts are not assigned the Token Creator (iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator) or Account User (iam.serviceAccountUser) roles. These privileged roles allow the members to impersonate service accounts by creating tokens or using the service account identity to access resources, which could lead to privilege escalation if compromised. The recommended approach is to use more restrictive roles that provide only the necessary permissions required for the specific workload, as shown in the secure example below where a standard `editor` role is used instead of these high-risk roles:\n\n```terraform\nresource \"google_project_iam_member\" \"secure_example\" {\n  project = \"your-project-id\"\n  role    = \"roles/editor\"\n  member  = \"user:jane@example.com\"\n}\n```",
