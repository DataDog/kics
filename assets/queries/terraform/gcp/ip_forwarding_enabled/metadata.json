  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the `can_ip_forward` attribute for Google Compute Engine instances is set to `false`, which prevents instances from forwarding packets not addressed to them. If `can_ip_forward` is set to `true`, as shown below, the instance could be misused as a routing or proxy device, increasing the risk of data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks:\n\n```\nresource \"google_compute_instance\" \"appserver\" {\n  name           = \"primary-application-server\"\n  machine_type   = \"e2-medium\"\n  can_ip_forward = true\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nTo mitigate this risk, configure the attribute as `false`:\n\n```\nresource \"google_compute_instance\" \"appserver\" {\n  name           = \"primary-application-server\"\n  machine_type   = \"e2-medium\"\n  can_ip_forward = false\n  ...\n}\n```\nDisabling IP forwarding hardens network boundaries and reduces the attack surface of the cloud environment.",
