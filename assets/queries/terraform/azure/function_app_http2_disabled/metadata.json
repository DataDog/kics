  "descriptionText": "Enabling HTTP/2 for Azure Function Apps improves security and performance by providing better encryption and more efficient use of network resources compared to HTTP/1.1. If the `http2_enabled` attribute is not set to `true` in the `site_config` block, as shown below, the Function App defaults to HTTP/1.1, exposing it to potential vulnerabilities like protocol downgrade attacks and inefficient data transfer:\n\n```\nsite_config {\n  http2_enabled = true\n}\n```\n\nLeaving HTTP/2 disabled can result in degraded application security and responsiveness, making services more vulnerable to exploitation and less performant for end users.",
