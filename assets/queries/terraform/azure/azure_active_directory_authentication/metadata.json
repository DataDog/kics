  "descriptionText": "Azure Service Fabric clusters should be configured to use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication to ensure secure identity management and access control. Omitting the `tenant_id` attribute in the `azure_active_directory` block, as shown below, may result in incomplete AAD integration, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the Service Fabric cluster:\n\n```\nazure_active_directory {\n  cluster_application_id = \"id\"\n  client_application_id = \"id\"\n}\n```\n\nTo enforce proper authentication, always specify the `tenant_id` alongside the application IDs:\n\n```\nazure_active_directory {\n  tenant_id = \"id\"\n  cluster_application_id = \"id\"\n  client_application_id = \"id\"\n}\n```\n\nFailure to correctly implement AAD authentication increases the risk of unauthorized cluster access and potential exposure of sensitive workloads and management endpoints.",
