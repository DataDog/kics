  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "Allowing public network access to Azure Cognitive Search exposes the service to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. In Terraform, this is controlled by the `public_network_access_enabled` attribute; setting this attribute to `true` permits public connections, while setting it to `false` restricts access to trusted, private networks only. For example, a secure configuration would look like the following:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_search_service\" \"example\" {\n  name                          = \"example-search-service\"\n  resource_group_name           = azurerm_resource_group.example.name\n  location                      = azurerm_resource_group.example.location\n  sku                           = \"standard\"\n  public_network_access_enabled = false\n}\n```\n\nLeaving public access enabled may allow attackers to enumerate, access, or exfiltrate sensitive search indexes and data.",
