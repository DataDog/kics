  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "To ensure data transmitted to and from Azure Storage Accounts remains protected, it is important to enforce the use of the latest supported TLS encryption protocol. If the `min_tls_version` attribute is set to an outdated protocol such as `\"TLS1_1\"`, as seen below, the storage account may be vulnerable to known security exploits:\n\n```\n  min_tls_version = \"TLS1_1\"\n```\n\nTo mitigate this risk, configure storage accounts to use at least TLS 1.2 by setting:\n\n```\n  min_tls_version = \"TLS1_2\"\n```\n\nFailing to enforce modern TLS versions can expose sensitive data in transit to interception or tampering by attackers.",
