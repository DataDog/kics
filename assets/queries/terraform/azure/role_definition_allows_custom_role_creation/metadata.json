  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Allowing the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write` action in a custom Azure role definition grants users the ability to create, modify, or delete role definitions within the assigned scope. This level of permission can lead to privilege escalation, where a malicious or compromised user can create overly permissive roles or alter existing ones. To mitigate this risk, custom roles should be limited to `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/read`, as shown below:\n\n```\npermissions {\n  actions = [\"Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/read\"]\n  not_actions = []\n}\n```\n\nRestricting write access helps protect against unauthorized changes to role definitions and reduces the attack surface for privilege escalation.",
