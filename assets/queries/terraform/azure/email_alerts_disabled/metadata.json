  "descriptionText": "Azure Security Center contact alert notifications should be enabled to ensure that designated security contacts receive email alerts about security issues or threats in your Azure environment. If the `alert_notifications` attribute is set to `false`, such as in \n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_security_center_contact\" \"example\" {\n    email = \"contact@example.com\"\n    phone = \"+1-555-555-5555\"\n    alert_notifications = false\n}\n```\n\ncritical security incidents could go unnoticed, increasing the risk of delayed response to threats. Setting `alert_notifications = true` ensures timely awareness and response to potential security incidents.",
