  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "This check ensures that the Azure Application Gateway has its Web Application Firewall (WAF) correctly configured and enabled, as indicated by the `waf_configuration { enabled = true }` attribute in Terraform. If WAF is not enabled or omitted from the configuration, the application gateway is left unprotected against common web attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, increasing the risk of a successful attack. To mitigate this vulnerability, always configure WAF with `enabled = true`, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_application_gateway\" \"example\" {\n  // ... other settings ...\n  waf_configuration {\n    enabled = true\n  }\n}\n```",
