  "severity": "INFO",
  "category": "Best Practices",
  "descriptionText": "To ensure proper resource ownership and management accountability in Azure environments, all resources should include a `team` tag within their `tags` block. Without this tag, as shown below, it becomes difficult to identify who is responsible for the resource, increasing the risk of unmanaged assets, security oversights, and operational inefficiencies:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_storage_account\" \"bad_example_no_tags\" {\n  name                     = \"badstorageacct\"\n  resource_group_name      = \"example-rg\"\n  location                 = \"East US\"\n  account_tier             = \"Standard\"\n  account_replication_type = \"LRS\"\n}\n```\n\nProperly tagging resources with a `team` value, such as in this example, helps organizations implement cost controls, streamline incident response, and maintain compliance by ensuring every asset has clear ownership:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_storage_account\" \"good_example\" {\n  name                     = \"goodstorageacct\"\n  resource_group_name      = \"example-rg\"\n  location                 = \"East US\"\n  account_tier             = \"Standard\"\n  account_replication_type = \"LRS\"\n  tags = {\n    team = \"DevOps\"\n  }\n}\n```",
