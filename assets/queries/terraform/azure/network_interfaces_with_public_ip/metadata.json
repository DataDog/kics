  "descriptionText": "Exposing network interfaces with a public IP address in Terraform (`public_ip_address_id` attribute) can introduce significant security risks, as it enables direct access from the internet to associated resources, increasing the attack surface for unauthorized access and attacks. If a public IP is required, additional controls and security baselines should be strictly enforced to minimize exposure. To enhance security, network interfaces should be defined without the `public_ip_address_id` field, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_network_interface\" \"secure\" {\n  name                = \"example-nic\"\n  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location\n  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name\n\n  ip_configuration {\n    name                          = \"internal\"\n    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.example.id\n    private_ip_address_allocation = \"Dynamic\"\n  }\n}\n```",
