  "descriptionText": "Enabling client certificates for Azure App Service ensures that only authenticated clients can access the application by requiring a client SSL certificate in all HTTPS requests. If the `client_cert_enabled` attribute is not set to `true`, unauthorized users could potentially connect to the service, increasing the risk of data leaks or abuse. To secure the App Service, always configure the resource as follows:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_app_service\" \"example\" {\n  // ... other configuration ...\n  client_cert_enabled = true\n}\n```",
