  "descriptionText": "This check identifies Azure network security rules that expose sensitive ports (such as 23 [Telnet], 110 [POP3], or others) to the entire internet, creating a significant security vulnerability. When sensitive ports are accessible from any source IP (`/0`, `0.0.0.0/0`, or similar notation), attackers can exploit these services to gain unauthorized access, perform reconnaissance, or execute service-specific attacks. To remediate this issue, either deny access to these ports, restrict access to specific IP addresses, or change the protocol. For example, use `access = \"Deny\"` for sensitive ports, or replace `source_address_prefix = \"0.0.0.0/0\"` or `source_address_prefix = \"/0\"` with a more restrictive value such as `source_address_prefix = \"192.168.0.0\".",
