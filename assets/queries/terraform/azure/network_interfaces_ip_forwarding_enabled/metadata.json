      "descriptionText": "Enabling IP forwarding on network interfaces allows packets to be routed between networks, which can make the network interface behave like a router. This may expose your environment to lateral movement and man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker gains access to the interface. To prevent this risk, set the `enable_ip_forwarding` attribute to `false` in your Terraform configuration, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_network_interface\" \"secure\" {\n  // ... other configuration ...\n  enable_ip_forwarding = false\n}\n```"
