  "category": "Insecure Configurations",
  "descriptionText": "Selecting the appropriate pricing tier for Azure Security Center is crucial for ensuring comprehensive security monitoring and protection. If the `tier` attribute in the `azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing` resource is set to `\"Free\"`, as shown below:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing\" \"example\" {\n   tier = \"Free\"\n}\n```\n\nthe configuration provides only limited security features and monitoring capabilities, leaving the environment more vulnerable to threats. Upgrading to the `\"Standard\"` tier, as recommended:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_security_center_subscription_pricing\" \"example\" {\n   tier = \"Standard\"\n}\n```\n\nenables advanced security features such as threat detection and automated response, significantly reducing the risk of undetected attacks and data breaches.",
