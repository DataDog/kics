  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Observability",
  "descriptionText": "Auditing should be enabled for MSSQL servers to ensure that access and activity logs are generated and retained for security monitoring and incident response. Without the `azurerm_mssql_server_extended_auditing_policy` resource configured, suspicious activities or potential breaches may go undetected, increasing the risk of data compromise. Ensuring auditing is on can be achieved by adding a resource like:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_mssql_server_extended_auditing_policy\" \"example\" {\n  database_id      = azurerm_mssql_database.example.id\n  storage_endpoint = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_blob_endpoint\n  retention_in_days = 6\n}\n```",
