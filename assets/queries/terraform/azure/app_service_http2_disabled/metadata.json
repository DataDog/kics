  "descriptionText": "Enabling HTTP/2 for Azure App Service is essential for improved security and performance, as HTTP/2 offers better data encryption, reduced latency, and protection against certain protocol-level attacks. If the `http2_enabled` attribute is not set to `true` in the `site_config` block, as shown below, the app service will only support HTTP/1.1, making it more vulnerable to downgrade attacks and less efficient in handling modern web traffic.\n\n```\nsite_config {\n  http2_enabled = true\n}\n```\nNeglecting to enable HTTP/2 may expose applications to increased risks and degrade the overall performance and user experience.",
