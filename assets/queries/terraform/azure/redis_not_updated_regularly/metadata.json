  "descriptionText": "Configuring an Azure Redis Cache without a regular patch schedule leaves the service vulnerable to missing important security and operational updates, increasing the risk of exploitation by attackers targeting known vulnerabilities. By using the `patch_schedule` block in Terraform, such as shown below, organizations can ensure updates are applied in a timely manner, minimizing the attack surface and helping maintain service reliability and compliance:\n\n```\npatch_schedule {\n    day_of_week     = \"Thursday\"\n    start_hour_utc  = 7\n}\n```\n\nFailure to address this may result in exposure to security threats or outages due to unpatched software flaws.",
