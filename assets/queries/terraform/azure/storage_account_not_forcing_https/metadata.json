  "descriptionText": "Storage accounts should enforce the use of HTTPS by setting the `https_traffic_only_enabled` attribute to `true` in the Terraform configuration. Allowing HTTP traffic (`https_traffic_only_enabled = false`) exposes sensitive data to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks during transit. A secure configuration should look like the following:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_storage_account\" \"secure_example\" {\n  // ... other configuration ...\n  https_traffic_only_enabled = true\n}\n```\n\nEnforcing HTTPS ensures all connections to the storage account are encrypted, protecting data integrity and confidentiality.",
