  "queryName": "AKS RBAC disabled",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Role Based Access Control (RBAC) should be enabled on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to enforce fine-grained authorization and restrict access to cluster resources. If `role_based_access_control_enabled = false` or `role_based_access_control { enabled = false }` is present in the Terraform configuration, users may gain excessive or unauthorized permissions within the cluster, increasing risk of accidental or malicious actions. Properly configuring RBAC (for example, by using `role_based_access_control_enabled = true`) helps ensure only authorized identities can perform sensitive operations within the AKS environment.",
