If `ssl_enforcement_enabled` is set to `false`, as shown below, database connections can occur over unencrypted channels, potentially exposing sensitive information such as credentials and application data to interception and misuse.\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_mysql_server\" \"example\" {\n  ...\n  ssl_enforcement_enabled = false\n}\n```\n\nEnabling SSL enforcement mitigates this risk by ensuring that all clients must connect using SSL, protecting data in transit.",
