  "severity": "HIGH",
  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "When SSL enforcement is disabled on Azure MySQL Database Servers, connections to the database are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception. This security vulnerability allows attackers to potentially capture sensitive data transmitted between client applications and the database server, including credentials, personally identifiable information, and business-critical data. To secure your MySQL server, you must explicitly set `ssl_enforcement_enabled` to `ENABLED`, as shown below:\n\n```terraform\nresource \"azurerm_mysql_server\" \"good_example\" {\n  name                = \"good-mysql-server\"\n  location            = \"East US\"\n  resource_group_name = \"example-rg\"\n\n  ssl_enforcement_enabled = [\"ENABLED\"]\n}\n```",
