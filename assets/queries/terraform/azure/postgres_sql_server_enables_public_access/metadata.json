  "descriptionText": "PostgreSQL servers with public network access enabled are directly accessible from the internet, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users and increasing the attack surface. When public_network_access_enabled is set to true or omitted (which defaults to true), your database becomes vulnerable to brute force attacks, SQL injection attempts, and other exploits originating from the public internet. To mitigate this risk, always explicitly set public_network_access_enabled to false as shown in the following secure example: `public_network_access_enabled = [false]`. For additional security, consider implementing private endpoints, firewalls, and virtual network service endpoints.",
