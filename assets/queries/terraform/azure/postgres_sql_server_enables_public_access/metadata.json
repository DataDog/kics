  "descriptionText": "PostgreSQL servers with public network access enabled are directly accessible from the internet, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users and increasing the attack surface. When `public_network_access_enabled` is set to `true` or omitted (which defaults to `true`), your database becomes vulnerable to brute force attacks, SQL injection attempts, and other exploits originating from the public internet. To mitigate this risk, always explicitly set `public_network_access_enabled` to `false`, as shown in the following secure example: `public_network_access_enabled = [false]`. For additional security, consider implementing private endpoints, firewalls, and virtual network service endpoints.",
