  "category": "Encryption",
  "descriptionText": "When creating Azure managed disks with Terraform, it is important to ensure that encryption is enabled to protect data at rest. If the `encryption_settings` block either has `enabled = false` or is omitted entirely, as shown below, the disk's contents are left unencrypted and may be exposed if the disk is compromised or accessed by unauthorized users.:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_managed_disk\" \"example\" {\n  // ... other parameters ...\n  encryption_settings = {\n    enabled = false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEnabling encryption with `encryption_settings = { enabled = true }` ensures sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access and helps meet compliance requirements.",
