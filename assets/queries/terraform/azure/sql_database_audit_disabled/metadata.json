  "descriptionText": "Enabling `Threat Detection` for Azure SQL Database helps identify anomalous activities and potential security threats by alerting administrators when suspicious activity is detected. If the threat_detection_policy block is set to `state = \"Disabled\"` or omitted entirely, as in the following configuration, threat detection will not be active: \n\n```\nthreat_detection_policy {\n  state = \"Disabled\"\n}\n```\n\nThis increases the risk that unusual access patterns or potential SQL injection attacks go unnoticed, potentially leading to data breaches or data loss. To secure your deployment, configure the `threat_detection_policy` block as follows:\n\n```\nthreat_detection_policy {\n  state = \"Enabled\"\n}\n```\nIf left unaddressed, disabling this feature may allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in your database environment undetected.",
