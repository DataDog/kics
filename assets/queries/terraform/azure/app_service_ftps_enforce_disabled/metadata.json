  "descriptionText": "App Service FTPS enforcement should be configured by setting the `ftps_state` attribute to `\"FtpsOnly\"` in the `site_config` block for the `azurerm_app_service` resource. Allowing `\"AllAllowed\"` in this setting permits both unencrypted FTP and encrypted FTPS connections, exposing sensitive data to potential interception or tampering during transit. To ensure data confidentiality and compliance, always use:\n\n```\nftps_state = \"FtpsOnly\"\n```\nwhich enforces encrypted connections to the Azure App Service.",
