  "descriptionText": "Azure Function Apps should be configured to use the latest supported TLS version to ensure encrypted communications and protect data in transit. If the `min_tls_version` attribute is set to an outdated value such as `1.1`, as in:\n\n```\nsite_config {\n  min_tls_version = 1.1\n}\n```\n\nthe application becomes susceptible to known TLS vulnerabilities and exploits. Setting `min_tls_version` to at least `1.2`, as in\n\n```\nsite_config {\n  min_tls_version = 1.2\n}\n```\n\nmitigates these risks and enforces stronger secure connections with clients.",
