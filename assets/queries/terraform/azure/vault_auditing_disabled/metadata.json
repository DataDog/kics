  "descriptionText": "Enabling logging for Azure Key Vault ensures that all access and management activities are captured and can be monitored for unauthorized or anomalous activity. Without logging enabled—such as omitting a `azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting` resource—critical security events and access records would not be recorded, making it difficult to detect potential breaches or comply with audit requirements. A secure configuration includes adding a diagnostic setting, for example:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting\" \"example\" {\n  name               = \"example\"\n  target_resource_id = azurerm_key_vault.example.id\n  storage_account_id = azurerm_storage_account.example.id\n\n  log {\n    category = \"AuditEvent\"\n    enabled  = true\n  }\n}\n```\nThis logs Key Vault events and helps ensure accountability and traceability for sensitive key and secret operations.",
