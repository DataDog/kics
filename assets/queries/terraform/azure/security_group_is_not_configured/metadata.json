  "descriptionText": "Network Security Groups (NSGs) in Azure provide filtering of network traffic to and from Azure resources within an Azure Virtual Network. When a subnet is not configured with an NSG, it lacks essential security controls that filter inbound and outbound traffic, potentially exposing resources to unauthorized access and network-based attacks. \n\nA properly secured Virtual Network requires the 'security_group' attribute to be defined with a valid NSG reference in each subnet configuration. Without this protection, workloads running in these subnets may be accessible from unwanted network sources, increasing the attack surface.\n\nSecure example:\n```terraform\nsubnet {\n  name           = \"subnet1\"\n  address_prefix = \"10.1.2.0/25\"\n  security_group = \"securitygroup-name\"\n}\n```\n\nVulnerable example:\n```terraform\nsubnet {\n  name           = \"subnet1\"\n  address_prefix = \"10.1.2.0/25\"\n  // Missing security_group attribute\n}\n```",
