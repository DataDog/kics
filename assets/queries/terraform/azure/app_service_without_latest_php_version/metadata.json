  "descriptionText": "Web apps using outdated PHP versions expose themselves to known security vulnerabilities and miss critical security fixes and performance improvements available in newer releases. For example, specifying `php_version = \"7.3\"` in a Terraform `azurerm_app_service` resource leaves the application open to exploits that are resolved in later PHP versions. To mitigate risk, always configure the `site_config` block to use a recent, supported PHP version, such as:\n\n```\nsite_config {\n  php_version = \"8.1\"\n}\n```\nThis ensures the application benefits from the latest patches and features.",
