  "descriptionText": "Web apps using outdated PHP versions expose themselves to known security vulnerabilities and miss critical security fixes and performance improvements available in newer releases. For example, specifying `php_version = \"7.3\"` in a Terraform `azurerm_app_service` resource leaves the application open to exploits that are resolved in later PHP versions. To mitigate risk, always configure the `site_config` block to use a recent, supported PHP version, such as:\n\n```\nsite_config {\n  php_version = \"8.1\"\n}\n```\nThis ensures the application benefits from the latest patches and features.",

Using the latest PHP version for web apps is recommended in order to take advantage of security fixes, if any, and/or additional functionalities of the newer version."
