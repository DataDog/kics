  "severity": "HIGH",
  "category": "Networking and Firewall",
  "descriptionText": "Network Security Group (NSG) rules that allow unrestricted UDP traffic from the internet (`0.0.0.0/0`) create significant security vulnerabilities in Azure environments. UDP is a connectionless protocol that doesn't provide built-in security controls, making services using it particularly susceptible to DDoS attacks, packet spoofing, and unauthorized access when exposed publicly. Instead of using broad source address prefixes like `0.0.0.0/0`, restrict inbound UDP traffic to specific IP ranges or CIDR blocks that require access.\n\nSecure example:\n```\nsecurity_rule {\n  protocol                  = \"udp\"\n  source_address_prefix     = \"192.168.1.0/24\"\n  destination_port_range    = \"53\"\n}\n```\n\nVulnerable example:\n```\nsecurity_rule {\n  protocol                  = \"udp\"\n  source_address_prefix     = \"0.0.0.0/0\"\n  destination_port_range    = \"53\"\n}\n```",
