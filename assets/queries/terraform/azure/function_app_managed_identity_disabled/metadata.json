  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Insecure Configurations",
  "descriptionText": "Azure Function Apps should have managed identities enabled to allow for secure authentication to Azure services without the need for hard-coded credentials. If the `identity` block is omitted in a Terraform resource, as in the example below, the Function App will not have a managed identity and may rely on less secure methods, such as embedding credentials in code or configuration:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_function_app\" \"insecure\" {\n  name                       = \"test-azure-functions\"\n  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.example.location\n  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.example.name\n  app_service_plan_id        = azurerm_app_service_plan.example.id\n  storage_account_name       = azurerm_storage_account.example.name\n  storage_account_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key\n}\n```\n\nEnabling a managed identity using the `identity { type = \"SystemAssigned\" }` block in your configuration ensures secure service-to-service communication and reduces the risk of credential leakage:\n\n```\nresource \"azurerm_function_app\" \"secure\" {\n  name                       = \"test-azure-functions\"\n  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.example.location\n  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.example.name\n  app_service_plan_id        = azurerm_app_service_plan.example.id\n  storage_account_name       = azurerm_storage_account.example.name\n  storage_account_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key\n\n  identity {\n    type = \"SystemAssigned\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLeaving this unaddressed may expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to connected Azure resources through weaker authentication mechanisms.",
