  "queryName": "Small MSSQL Server Audit Retention",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "category": "Observability",
  "descriptionText": "SQL Server auditing logs should be retained for more than 90 days to ensure sufficient historical data is available for security investigations and compliance requirements. When the `retention_in_days` attribute in the `extended_auditing_policy` block is set below 91, such as in the following Terraform snippet, essential audit records may be lost due to premature log deletion:\n\n```\nextended_auditing_policy {\n  storage_endpoint            = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_blob_endpoint\n  storage_account_access_key  = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key\n  retention_in_days           = 20\n}\n```\n\nA secure configuration should set `retention_in_days` to at least 91, as shown below, to ensure audit logs are preserved for sufficient time:\n\n```\nextended_auditing_policy {\n  storage_endpoint            = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_blob_endpoint\n  storage_account_access_key  = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key\n  retention_in_days           = 91\n}\n```\n\nFailing to enforce adequate audit log retention can prevent detection of security incidents and undermine compliance with regulatory standards.",
