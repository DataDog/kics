  "descriptionText": "SQL Server auditing should be enabled to ensure that all database events and activities are properly logged for security monitoring and compliance purposes. Without the `extended_auditing_policy` block set as shown below, malicious or unauthorized actions may go undetected, increasing the risk of data breaches and making forensic analysis difficult. For example, secure Terraform configuration includes:\n\n```\nextended_auditing_policy {\n   storage_endpoint           = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_blob_endpoint\n   storage_account_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key\n   storage_account_access_key_is_secondary = true\n   retention_in_days                       = 90\n}\n```",
