  "category": "Best Practices",
  "descriptionText": "It is recommended to specify the latest supported Python version for the `python_version` attribute in the `site_config` block of the `azurerm_app_service` resource. Using outdated Python versions, such as `\"python_version = \\\"2.7\\\"\"`, exposes your application to known security vulnerabilities and prevents access to important features and security updates available in newer releases. To reduce risk, configure the resource with an up-to-date version. For example:\n\n```\nsite_config {\n  python_version = \"3.10\"\n}\n```",
