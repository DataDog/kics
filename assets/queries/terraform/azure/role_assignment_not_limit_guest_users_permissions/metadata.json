  "descriptionText": "Role assignments in Terraform should strictly limit permissions granted to guest users. If the `actions` attribute in the `azurerm_role_definition` resource is set to `[\"*\"]`, guest users receive unrestricted permissions within the scope, potentially allowing them to perform any action, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data. It is recommended to set `actions = []` and `not_actions = [\"*\"]` to ensure that guest users have no actionable privileges, thereby protecting critical resources from unauthorized access.\n\n```\npermissions {\n  actions     = []\n  not_actions = [\"*\"]\n}\n```",
