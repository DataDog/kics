  "descriptionText": "GitHub Actions workflows are triggered by many events and receive a GitHub context containing event details (for example: triggering user, branch name, repository name, commit hash, and pull request number). Some fields — such as the base repository name, the changeset commit hash, or a pull request number — are generally not controlled by the user who triggered the event and therefore are unlikely vectors for injection.",
