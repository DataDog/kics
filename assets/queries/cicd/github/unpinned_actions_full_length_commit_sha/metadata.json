  "descriptionText": "Pin an action to a full-length commit SHA (the complete 40-character SHA-1) to use it as an immutable release. Pinning to a specific SHA reduces the risk of a malicious actor injecting a backdoor, because an attacker would need to produce a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object to replace the commit. When selecting a SHA, verify it comes from the actionâ€™s original repository (not a fork) and that you are using the full commit SHA.",
