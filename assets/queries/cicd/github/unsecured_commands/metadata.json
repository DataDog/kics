  "descriptionText": "Deprecated commands set-env and add-path can be explicitly re-enabled by setting the ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS environment variable to true. Re-enabling them can allow an attacker to modify the system PATH so a different executable is run than intended, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Do not enable this variable; use the supported environment and path file mechanisms (for example, GITHUB_ENV and GITHUB_PATH) instead.",
