  "descriptionText": "GitHub Actions workflows are triggered by various events and each trigger supplies a GitHub context with event informationâ€”who triggered it, branch names, and other metadata. Some context fields (for example, the base repository name, the commit hash for a changeset, or the pull request number) are generally not controlled by the user who triggered the event and therefore are unlikely to be used for injection.",
