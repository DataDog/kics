  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Roles or ClusterRoles with the `impersonate` permission allow subjects to assume the rights of other users, groups, or service accounts. If an identity with such permissions is compromised, attackers can abuse this sudo-like capability to escalate privileges and act with the impersonated principals' access. Misuse of the `impersonate` permission can enable lateral movement, persistent access, and the bypass of intended permission boundaries. For these reasons, `impersonate` is considered a high-risk permission and is commonly subject to restriction and monitoring.",
