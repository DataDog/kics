  "descriptionText": "CPU requests should be set to ensure the total resource requests of scheduled containers are less than the node's capacity. This rule checks both `initContainers` and `containers` for the presence of a `resources` field, a `resources.requests` map, and a `cpu` entry within `requests`. It reports a MissingAttribute issue when any container is missing `resources`, missing `requests`, or missing CPU requests to help enforce proper schedulability and capacity planning.",
