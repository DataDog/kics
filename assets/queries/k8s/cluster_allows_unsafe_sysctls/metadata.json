  "descriptionText": "A Kubernetes cluster must not allow unsafe sysctls. Allowing unsafe sysctls can let a Pod influence other Pods, harm node stability, or consume CPU or memory beyond resource limits.\n\n`spec.securityContext.sysctls` must not include unsafe sysctls, and `allowedUnsafeSysctls` must be undefined. This rule detects PodSecurityPolicy resources where `allowedUnsafeSysctls` is defined and flags any `spec.securityContext.sysctls` entries that are not in the defined safe list.\n\nOnly a limited set of sysctls are considered safe; all others are treated as unsafe and should not be used.",
