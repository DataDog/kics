  "descriptionText": "The Service must target at least one Pod. Its `.spec.selector` must match labels on Pod-bearing resources (Pod, ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, Job, or CronJob job template).\nEach Service port must reference a container port on at least one matched Pod â€” either by numeric `targetPort`, by named `targetPort`, or by falling back to the Service `port` when `targetPort` is unspecified.",
