  "queryName": "RBAC roles with attach permission",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Roles or ClusterRoles that permit attaching to containers via `kubectl attach` can be abused by attackers to read process output (stdout, stderr) and send input (stdin) to running processes. They can also allow a malicious user to attach to a privileged container, resulting in privilege escalation. For this reason, the `pods/attach` resource should not be included in production Role or ClusterRole rules. This rule flags Role or ClusterRole documents whose rules include the `pods/attach` resource (and related verb entries such as `create` or `*`). Findings support least-privilege enforcement by identifying and removing attach permissions from cluster roles.",
