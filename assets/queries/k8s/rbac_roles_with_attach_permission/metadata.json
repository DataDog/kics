  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "Roles or ClusterRoles with permissions to attach to containers via `kubectl attach` could be abused by attackers to read log output (stdout, stderr) and send input data (stdin) to running processes. Additionally, it could allow a malicious user to attach to a privileged container, resulting in privilege escalation. To prevent this, the `pods/attach` verb should not be used in production environments.",
