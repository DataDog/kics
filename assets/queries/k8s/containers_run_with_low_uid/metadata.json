  "descriptionText": "Containers should not run with a UID below 10000, as this may cause conflicts with the host's user table. A container can inherit runAsUser from the pod; both pod- and container-level runAsUser are evaluated. This rule flags containers whose runAsUser is undefined or set to a UID less than 10000.",
