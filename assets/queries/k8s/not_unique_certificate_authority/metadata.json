  "descriptionText": "The trusted certificate authority file used by etcd must be different from the client certificate authority file used by the API server. Do not set `--trusted-ca-file` for etcd to the same path as the API server's `--client-ca-file`. Sharing the same CA file can allow clients authenticated to the API server to be implicitly trusted by etcd, weakening isolation and increasing risk.",
