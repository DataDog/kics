  "descriptionText": "When a container command includes `etcd`, the `--peer-cert-file` and `--peer-key-file` flags should be set. The rule inspects both initContainers and containers and reports a MissingAttribute when any required flag is not present in the container's command. The result identifies the resource and the command position where the missing flag was detected.",
