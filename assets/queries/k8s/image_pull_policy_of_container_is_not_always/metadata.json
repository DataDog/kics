  "category": "Insecure Configurations",
  "descriptionText": "The container `imagePullPolicy` must be set to `Always`. This requirement applies when the image is referenced with an explicit tag (contains ':') and is not referenced by digest (`@...`) or by the `:latest` tag. Setting `imagePullPolicy` to `Always` ensures the image is pulled on every start and prevents relying on mutable images cached locally.",
