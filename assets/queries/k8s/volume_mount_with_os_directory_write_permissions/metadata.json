  "descriptionText": "Containers can mount sensitive directories from the host, granting potentially dangerous access to critical host configurations and binaries.\nThis rule flags container volume mounts where the mountPath is a host-sensitive directory (for example `/bin`, `/etc`, `/proc`, or `/`) and the `readOnly` attribute is missing or set to false.\nSuch mounts are expected to be set to read-only to avoid modification of host files and reduce the risk of privilege escalation or system compromise.",
