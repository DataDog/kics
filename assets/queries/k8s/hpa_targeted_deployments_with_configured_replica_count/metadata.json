  "descriptionText": "Deployments targeted by HorizontalPodAutoscaler should not include a statically configured replica count. This rule flags Deployments referenced by an HPA via the `scaleTargetRef` when the Deployment's `spec.replicas` field is defined. A defined `spec.replicas` can conflict with the HPA's scaling decisions and should be undefined so the HorizontalPodAutoscaler can manage replica count.",
